# Evolutionary Algorithms For Adversarial Game Playing
The goal of this project is to appreciate the efficacy of Evolutionary Algorithms, specifically Genetic Algorithm (GA), in the context of game theory. I used the DEAP package for Genetic Algorithm in order to evolve strategies for repeatedly playing variants of The Tragedy of the Commons (TC).
