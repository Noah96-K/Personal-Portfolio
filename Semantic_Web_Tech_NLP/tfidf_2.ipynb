       " '87049088': 'There is controversy regarding the appropriate utilization of health care resources in the management of tricyclic antidepressant overdosage. Antidepressant overdose patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) are routinely admitted to intensive care units, but only a small proportion develop cardiac arrhythmias or other complications requiring such an environment. The authors reviewed the findings in 165 patients presenting to an ED with antidepressant overdose. They found that major manifestations of toxicity on ED evaluation (altered mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, and conduction defects) were commonly associated with a complicated hospital course. Patients with the isolated findings of sinus tachycardia or QTc prolongation had no complications. No patient experienced a serious toxic event without major evidence of toxicity on ED evaluation and continued evidence of toxicity during the hospital course. These data support the concept that proper ED evaluation can identify a large body of patients with trivial ingestions who may not require hospital observation.',\n",
       " '87049089': 'As the use of helicopters for air transport of critically ill patients increases, the availability of monitoring devices for physiological parameters during flight becomes important. It has long been known that arterial PO2 (PaO2) decreases during unsupplemented, non-pressurized flight. In this study, the authors examined the use of the transconjunctival oxygen (cjO2) monitor for assessing the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in four healthy volunteers. Arterial PaO2 as measured by conventional blood gas analysis was compared with cjO2 at ground level, 5,000 feet, and 10,000 feet altitude. Mean PaO2 dropped significantly from 93.5 to 81.5 to 58.5 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Mean cjO2 also decreased significantly from 63.8 to 52.0 to 34.8 mm Hg, respectively (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance with repeated measures). Within individual subjects, cjO2 was an accurate predictor of PaO2 (P less than 0.001, multiple regression analysis). The relationship between cjO2 and PaO2 was linear with a regression coefficient of 1.147. The authors conclude that the transconjunctival O2 monitor may be useful for monitoring the adequacy of arterial oxygenation during helicopter flight in hemodynamically stable patients. The results of study also support the use of supplemental oxygen in all patients subjected to helicopter transport.',\n",
       " '87049090': 'A prospective clinical trial was conducted to estimate the rise in serum glucose level after an intravenous bolus of 50 ml of 50% dextrose solution (D-50) in the emergency department setting. Fifty one subjects with altered levels of consciousness were studied. Of these, 23 patients were known diabetics, and 28 were not diabetic. The change in glucose level for the total study group ranged from a low of 37 mg/dl to a high of 370 mg/dl, with a mean of 166 +/- 77 mg/dl. The mean for the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 177 +/- 80 mg/dl and 154 +/- 75 mg/dl. These results suggest that serum glucose levels cannot be quantitatively predicted after a single intravenous bolus of D-50.',\n",

Pertinent medical literature is reviewed, clinical considerations for the elderly patient are discussed, and suggestions for proper nasogastric tube placement are offered.',\n",

Intraosseous drug administration should be reserved for the rare critically ill child in whom vascular access proves impossible.',\n",
       " '87049098': 'Boerhaave\\'s syndrome represents a diagnostic dilemma for the emergency physician. The prognosis of this truly life-threatening emergency is darkened by any significant diagnostic delay. Unfortunately, classic or expected symptoms and signs are frequently absent at presentation, a circumstance that leads to frequent misdiagnosis. Two cases of Boerhaave\\'s syndrome with \"atypical\" clinical presentations are reviewed and discussed. It is clear that Boerhaave\\'s syndrome should always be suspected in the evaluation of any sudden chest, abdominal, or back pain associated with emesis. However, emphasis should be placed on the fact that this entity may occur without emesis. The chest radiograph is the most helpful diagnostic aid. Undoubtedly, maintenance of a high degree of suspicion by the emergency physician for Boerhaave\\'s syndrome will lead consistently to earlier diagnosis, and subsequent aggressive intervention should result in considerable reduction in rates of both morbidity and mortality.',\n",

       " '87049100': 'Intraosseous infusions were widely used in pediatric patients during the 1930s and 1940s. Recent reports have re-introduced this concept and confirmed its safety and ready accessability for fluid and drug administration. However, these reports have not addressed the difficulties encountered during insertion of the intraosseous needle. Spinal needles, standard metal intravenous (IV) needles, and bone marrow biopsy needles have been suggested for intraosseous infusion. These needles were tested for ease of insertion on a pediatric cadaver leg. The site for needle placement was also evaluated during the study. It was found that the 13-gauge Kormed/Jamshidi disposable bone marrow/aspiration needle was the easiest to insert and did not plug with bone or tissue during insertion. An area proximal to the medial malleolus was found to provide a stable, relatively flat, and easily penetrable location for needle placement. This method was successfully utilized in ten pediatric and five adult patients. Intraosseous needle placement is a safe, rapid method to gain access to the venous circulation. By utilizing these techniques, a stable, usable fluid line can be established in even the most dehydrated pediatric patients.',\n",
       " '87049101': 'The case of a man who injected turpentine intravenously in an attempt to kill himself is reported. The patient developed immediate pulmonary edema and hypoxia, followed later by cellulitis at the site of injection. Although only one death to date has been attributed to this form of chemical abuse, extensive local reactions, pulmonary involvement, central nervous system depression, and febrile reactions should be anticipated, and such patients should be admitted to the hospital. Patients should be observed for local reactions and myonecrosis around the site of injection, especially as these occur 12-24 hours later.',\n",

Cocaine has been adulterated or admixed with numerous substances, among them local anesthetics, amphetamine, phencyclidine, and strychnine. We report three cases of thallium poisoning following nasal insufflation of a substance that was believed to have been cocaine.',\n",
       " '87049103': \"The intravenous injection of ethchlorvynol is an uncommon cause of noncardiac pulmonary edema. Two cases of intravenous ethchlorvynol-induced pulmonary edema are presented. The patients fell asleep after injecting the liquid contents of Placydil capsules (ethchlorvynol) and awoke several hours later with severe dyspnea. Arterial blood gases demonstrated marked hypoxia. Chest radiographs revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar densities. The patients' symptoms and radiographic findings resolved after several days of supportive care. Changes in the lung caused by ethchlorvynol may be the result of direct effect of the drug on the lung.\",\n",

Three hours after admission for ingestion of at least 300 mg baclofen as a single dose, the patient became comatose and subsequently bradycardic, hypotensive, and hypothermic.

The recent 75-day implant supports the feasibility of extended reliability of the system components. Postoperative system maintenance was necessary only because of the nonhermetic design of System 7. However, the ability to pump 11 l/min at 120 beats/min, synchronize at beat rates of 144 beats/min, and pump against mean arterial pressures of more than 150 mmHg while maintaining hematologic and biochemical values within physiologic range sets a very optimistic stage for System 8 hardware.

The DFO infusion caused rises in plasma Al levels (regarded as indicating the elution of accumulated Al) in patients undergoing HD. Plasma levels increased most in long-term patients and those with bone pain. Examination of Al clearances demonstrated that this increased plasma Al content passed through HD membranes at levels of more than 80 micrograms/l, and that the leaky membrane was more effective for removal of Al as well as DFO than the conventional one.

Ten Holstein calves received 25-mm mitral valves (ISLM) and were killed 1, 14, and 30 days after implantation. Twenty-four hours before the calves were killed, 350 to 450 microCi of 111In-labeled platelets and 200 to 250 microCi of 125I-labeled bovine fibrinogen were administered intravenously. The components of the tissue valves, i.e., three leaflets and sewing rings, were separated. Each leaflet was cut into four sections: free edge, central zone, flexion zone, and attachment zone. From the radioactivity in blood, leaflet zones, sewing rings, area of leaflet zones, platelet count, and fibrinogen level in blood, the mean regional density of adherent platelets, fibrinogen-fibrin, and fibrinogen/platelet were calculated. The density of platelets and fibrinogen deposited on the components of the valves decreases with time postimplantation. The number of fibrinogen molecules per platelet is fivefold to 20-fold higher than that of the receptor concentration on platelets on leaflet zones, suggesting the heterogeneity of fibrinogen-fibrin in thrombus and components of the valve.',\n",

The mechanical response was measured using a strain gauge force transducer and the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) was recorded simultaneously using a Medelec MS91 electromyography system. Depression of the electromyographic and mechanical responses, caused by atracurium, was similar during onset and antagonism of blockade.

The rates of onset of atracurium and alcuronium were generally similar, but the rate of onset of mechanical fade was greater in the alcuronium group. There was no significant quantitative difference between the rates of antagonism of alcuronium and atracurium when assessed by the mechanical first response ratio. Electromyographic first response and electromyographic and mechanical train-of-four ratios recovered more rapidly in the atracurium group.

We used in vitro long-term bone marrow cultures to characterize further the nature of the hemopoietic microenvironmental defect in Sl/Sld mice. Sl/Sld mouse bone marrow cells consistently produced less than 10% of the total hemopoietic cells and multipotent and unipotent hemopoietic progenitor cells produced in cultures of marrow from normal, congenic +/+ mice. If fresh Sl/Sld and +/+ marrow cells were mixed prior to establishing long-term marrow cultures, there was a direct correlation between number of Sl/Sld cells added and degree of inhibition of +/+ hemopoiesis. A pre-established, confluent Sl/Sld adherent stromal layer inhibited hemopoiesis by fresh +/+ marrow cells by nearly 70%, as compared with dishes with irradiated +/+ or no stroma. This inhibitory effect was abrogated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma prior to addition of the fresh +/+ marrow cells. Similarly, unirradiated, but not 9 to 200 Gy irradiated Sl/Sld stroma inhibited proliferation of the factor-dependent FDC-P1 hemopoietic progenitor cell line. Thus, the Sl/Sld hemopoietic microenvironment actively inhibits hemopoiesis in vitro, and this inhibition can be at least partially eliminated by irradiation of the Sl/Sld stroma.',\n",
       " '87050034': 'Epinephrine causes platelet aggregation and secretion by interacting with alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on the platelet surface. Platelet aggregation requires the binding of fibrinogen to a specific receptor on the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex. Although the IIb-IIIa complex is identifiable on the surface of resting platelets, the fibrinogen receptor is expressed only after platelet activation. The current studies were designed to examine the effect of occupancy of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine on the expression of fibrinogen receptors and on the aggregation of platelets. The ability of epinephrine to induce the expression of fibrinogen receptors was studied under two different conditions: acute stimulation (less than 1 min) and prolonged stimulation (50 to 90 min), the latter of which is associated with a reduction or \"desensitization\" of the platelet aggregation response. Expression of the fibrinogen receptor was monitored with 125I-fibrinogen as well as with 125I-PAC-1 (PAC-1), a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex only after platelets are activated. Epinephrine caused an immediate increase in PAC-1 and fibrinogen binding that was dependent on occupancy of the alpha 2-receptor by epinephrine and on the presence of extracellular free Ca (KCa = 30 mumol/L). By itself, 1 mmol/L Mg was unable to support induction of the fibrinogen receptor by epinephrine. However, it did decrease the Ca requirement by about two orders of magnitude. Prolonged stimulation of unstirred platelets by epinephrine led to a 70% decrease in the aggregation response when the platelets were subsequently stirred. Despite their decreased aggregation response, desensitized platelets bound PAC-1 and fibrinogen normally, indicating that the loss of aggregation was not due simply to a decrease in fibrinogen receptor expression. Although desensitization was not affected by pretreatment of the platelets with aspirin, it was partially prevented when extracellular Ca was chelated by EDTA during the long incubation with epinephrine. These studies demonstrate that once platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are occupied by epinephrine, extracellular Ca is involved in initiating the aggregation response by supporting the induction of the fibrinogen receptor and the binding of fibrinogen. Furthermore. Ca-dependent reactions subsequent to fibrinogen binding may be necessary for maximal platelet aggregation and are impaired when platelets become desensitized to epinephrine.',\n",

Most peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals are covered with slender microvillus projections, but a large proportion of lymphocytes from WAS patients were found to be relatively devoid of microvilli. A lymphocyte morphology scoring system was developed to quantify the density of microvilli: Grade 4 classified those lymphocytes with greater than 75% of the surface covered with microvilli with progressive decrements to grade 1, which were those without microvilli. The mean lymphocyte morphology score of eight normal individuals was 3.62 +/- .22. The mean lymphocyte score of WAS patients was substantially lower (2.89 +/- .27, P less than .001). In addition, WAS lymphocytes often were qualitatively abnormal, with short, blunted microvilli.

We correlated the changes in RBC morphology and membrane protein composition after oxidant treatment with the alterations in deformability of whole cells and cell membranes. The incubation of RBCs with phenylhydrazine concentrations of 0.3 to 100 mg/dL at 37 degrees C for one hour led to a dose-dependent formation of Heinz bodies, ranging from isolated Heinz bodies at 1 mg/dL to a confluent coating of the inner membrane surface at 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of a large quantity of hemoglobin bound to the ghost membrane of treated RBCs. Electrophoresis with and without dithiothreitol indicated that disulfide bridges are abundant between hemoglobin molecules and are also present among membrane proteins but are not the major bond between hemoglobin and membrane. Changes of spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, and band 6 and the appearance of a 260,000-dalton complex were also observed. With phenylhydrazine concentrations below 30 mg/dL, even in the presence of multiple Heinz bodies, the RBC deformability measured by filtration through 2.6-, 4.5-, and 6.8-microns pores and the membrane deformability determined by a filter aspiration technique were not altered. With 100 mg/dL phenylhydrazine, when the entire membrane was coated with Heinz bodies, RBC filterability and membrane deformability were drastically reduced. These results indicate that oxidative damage of RBCs with discrete Heinz body formation causes focal membrane rigidification but does not affect the global cellular deformability until the Heinz bodies nearly cover the entire cell endoface.',\n",

Neuraminidase-inaccessible, ie residual cell-associated sialic acid after neuraminidase treatment, was four- to twelvefold lower in the three differentiation-inducer-resistant sublines than in the parent line.

However, neuraminidase treatment did not alter the sensitivity of wt HL-60 cells to differentiation induction by RA, hypoxanthine (purine base), or DMSO. These results indicate that differences in peripheral, neuraminidase-accessible sialic acids are important determinants of the gel electrophoretic mobility of the SMGs of the HL-60 line and sublines but are not likely related to the differentiation-resistance mechanism.

Ankle position and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. In 3 of 8 spastic patients tested, dorsiflexion evoked velocity-dependent activation of the antagonist (SOL) muscle which impeded the movement to the extent that the limb unintentionally reversed movement direction. We propose that this activation is reflex in origin since it is tightly synchronized, has a large peak amplitude, occurs about 50 ms after the initiation of the movement, and is velocity dependent. One of the 3 patients who had reflex-induced antagonist activation in dorsiflexion also demonstrated sustained clonus during plantarflexion.

To induce use of the nonpreferred limb, a bracelet, which prevented reaching but not other movements, was attached to the forearm of the preferred forelimb. Whereas small cortical lesions of the forepaw area of the sensorimotor cortex mildly influenced limb preference and use, larger lesions changed preference. Furthermore, medium-sized sensorimotor cortex lesions impaired contralateral limb use, although surprising recovery occurred on the forced tests with the bracelet. Large cortical lesions abolished effective reaching even on the forced tests. Impairments similar to those following sensorimotor cortex lesions were also obtained following small and large caudate-putamen lesions. By contrast, unilateral dopamine depletions not only blocked use of the limb contralateral to the depletion but also impaired use of the ipsilateral limb. There was recovery in use of the ipsilateral forelimb but not the contralateral forelimb. Correlational analysis showed a weak relation between methamphetamine-induced rotation and limb preference preoperatively but no significant relation between these two variables postoperatively.

This observation does not invalidate the concept of functional groupings within these anterior horn cell pools. In studies of the same segment in cords obtained at autopsy from patients with motor neuron disease, zones of focal loss of motor neurons were identified, without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. These findings imply varying resistance to the disease in different pools of motor neurons.',\n",
       " '87050707': 'Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.',\n",

In this longitudinal study, involving twice monthly samples from each participant and carried out in two phases lasting at least six and three months respectively, we have confirmed that fluctuations in T8+ cells occur in patients with MS and also found a significant reduction in this lymphocyte subpopulation in patients' spouses but not their siblings, compared with unrelated controls. The changes observed in spouses were related in time to those occurring in patients on 10/13 occasions from 5/9 families; no temporal relationship occurred in the remainder. Taking two or more low T8+ values as significant, 12/13 patients, 7/9 spouses, 6/13 siblings and 4/13 controls (chi 2 = 12.5; P less than 0.01) were abnormal at some stage.

There is oedema formation at 2 h after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation and especially with the combination of inhalation injury and fluid resuscitation [corrected]. This oedema appears to have decreased by 24 h post-injury. There does not appear to be any difference between the small- and medium-sized tracers in the transit times of tracer in the lung vascular compartment. The increases in extravascular water volume have been confirmed by gravimetric analyses of the lungs. Thus the pulmonary oedema in the rabbit animal model is detectable within 2 h post-injury, with a return towards normal values some time within 24 h if fluid challenged for short periods. Fluid resuscitation exacerbates the amount of oedema that developed. The onset of pulmonary oedema may therefore be earlier than previously seen clinically, and fluid resuscitation modifications may be of benefit in smoke inhalation injury.',\n",

Fifty patients showed evidence of current flow through their bodies. These 50 victims were classified into two groups, the first consisting of 9 victims who showed rupture of their clothes or linear superficial dermal burns along their whole bodies from head to feet, indicating the occurrence of surface flashovers. The remaining 41 patients showed no evidence of this flash effect. It is noteworthy that in the first group 5 of the 9 survived, whereas in the second group only 6 among 41 survived. The result indicates that when a flashover occurs along the whole body, the probability of survival is higher than 50 per cent. The conditions which determine death or survival were investigated experimentally, imposing artificial lightning voltage impulses on rats and developing flashovers on them. The rats survived when the voltage drop caused by flashover occurred immediately after the peak point, and the current waveform exhibited a sharp peak. In contrast, the rats were killed when the voltage drop caused by flashover was delayed by more than 20 microseconds, and the current waveform showed a blunt cone shape. It has been concluded that a fast flashover appreciably diminishes the energy dissipation within the body and consequently results in survival.',\n",

The onset of renal failure was temporally related to the use of a drug: a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) (in four patients), cimetidine (in three), antibiotics (in two) or allopurinol (in one). The onset of renal failure was acute in three patients and insidious in seven. Two patients also exhibited marked proteinuria. Clinical features such as fever, rash, hematuria, pyuria with or without eosinophiluria, and mild to marked proteinuria had led to suspicion of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy findings of inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. Three patients required hemodialysis; two of them received steroids as well. Steroid therapy was also used in two patients with NSAID-induced proteinuria. Renal function improved in nine patients by 35 days, but one patient continued to have slow but progressive deterioration of renal function. Acute interstitial nephritis can be distinguished from other forms of acute renal failure by heavy renal uptake of gallium 67, maximal 48 hours or more after injection.

Six cases of head and neck cancer with meningeal invasion are presented. All six cases had malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid. Three cases had malignant cells recovered from a ventricular specimen after lumbar punctures were negative. The most common clinical finding on presentation was cranial nerve involvement. The optic nerve was involved most often with nerves VI and V the next most frequent. Headache was present in four patients and seizures occurred in two. No patient had meningismus. Our current treatment plan involves insertion of an Ommaya Reservoir and intraventricular methotrexate. Only patients whose primary head and neck tumor shows a response to systemic therapy undergo Ommaya placement. Meningeal carcinomatosis in head and neck cancer may be more prevalent than previously thought and the likely mechanism is via direct extension rather than hematogenous spread.',\n",

Data analysis indicated significant (p less than 0.01) increases in the mean (+/- SD) TSA and TSA/TP values in the cancer patients (78.1 +/- 19.2 mg/dl and 12.4 +/- 3.8 mg/g, respectively) and in the pathologic controls (76.0 +/- 7.5 mg/dl and 11.6 +/- 2.5 mg/g) when compared to the normal controls (67.3 +/- 7.1 mg/dl and 9.0 +/- 1.1 mg/g), and a significant decrease in the mean TP values in the cancer patients (6.4 +/- 1.1 g/dl) and pathologic controls (6.6 +/- 1.1 g/dl) when compared to normal controls (7.5 +/- 0.5 g/dl). No significant difference was observed between groups in LASA values. Further analysis of the data in patient subgroups based on the tissue involved, specific disease, or severity of the malignancy indicated that the lack of specificity of the markers was due primarily to restricted subgroups and that the sensitivity of TSA and TSA/TP increased as the malignancy became more severe. The results show that TSA/TP was the most useful of the markers tested for detecting malignancies. This marker should prove useful for monitoring malignant disease recurrence and/or progression and for evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic approaches.',\n",

Calendar year of diagnosis, sex of the patient, and site of primary tumor were not significant prognostic factors. Further analysis shows that multimodal treatment with surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, especially in patients older than 1 year of age with Stage II disease, has influenced the survival significantly. The fact that age at diagnosis and the administration of chemotherapy have independent prognostic significance can be explained by the theory that all neuroblastomas are virtually congenital; therefore, the difference in age at diagnosis largely reflects the difference in growth rates of the tumor. Thus, according to this theory, age may be a measure of the probability of micrometastases in addition to the clinical extent or stage of the disease, as it represents the duration of the disease. Additional chemotherapy may thus have eradicated these micrometastases in the older children, since the age influence on Stage II disease disappeared when multimodal treatment was given in this study. The implications for treatment policy are discussed in view of this theory.',\n",

       " '87051268': 'Traditional therapy for malignant pleural effusions includes thoracentesis or tube drainage with instillation of irritants to achieve pleurodesis. This can require a lengthy hospitalization, causes pain and discomfort, and has an appreciable failure rate. Because of these drawbacks, the authors used a shunting device to transfer fluid to the peritoneal cavity in 17 patients with malignant pleural effusions. Eleven patients had undergone previous therapeutic thoracenteses and three had chest tube placement with failed sclerosis. The shunt was a subcutaneous valved pump chamber with attached pleural and peritoneal catheters, which used manual compression to transfer fluid against the normal abdominal/pleural pressure gradient. Operative placement under local or general anesthesia was performed without complication. Five patients achieved minimal benefit, either because of moribund status or their inability to compress the pump effectively. In the other 12 patients, there was radiographic evidence of diminished or stabilized pleural effusion; respiratory symptoms were effectively palliated, and no further treatment for their effusion was required. Peritoneal dissemination of malignant cells has not been clinically detected. We feel that pleuroperitoneal shunting is a valid new method for treatment of malignant pleural effusions which can effectively palliate respiratory symptoms with low morbidity. Advantages include the absence of external tubing and the possibility for only a short hospitalization or even outpatient placement. Shunting is applicable for patients who are able to perform the requisite pumping and is particularly suitable for those with trapped lungs or who have failed attempted pleural sclerosis.',\n",

Cardiac symptomatology is frequently difficult to differentiate from symptoms of pleuropulmonary disease. To better define the clinical characteristics of cardiac involvement in patients with mesothelioma, the electrocardiographic (EKG) and echocardiographic findings in 64 patients with biopsy-proven malignant pleural mesothelioma were reviewed. A total of 19/64 (30%) patients had autopsy studies available for review. The EKG was abnormal in 55 patients (89%). Over half (60%) had an arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia (42%), premature atrial and ventricular contractions (13%), atrial fibrillation (3%), and atrial flutter (1%). Over one third (37%) had a conduction abnormality, including bundle branch block (13%), hemiblock (8.5%), and incomplete right bundle branch block (13%). Echocardiography revealed a total of 13 patients with pericardial effusions, two with pericardial thickening, and one with an anterior sonolucent space. Of 19 autopsies, cardiac invasion was found in 14 (74%), with more than half to the pericardium and more than one quarter to the myocardium. It is concluded that: clinical cardiac abnormalities occur in the great majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, pathologic cardiac invasion occurs in the great majority of patients with pleural mesothelioma, and the EKG and echocardiogram are helpful in differentiating cardiac involvement from progressive pulmonary disease in patients with pleural mesothelioma.',\n",

Flow cytometry (FCM) and cytology were concordant in 57 of 103 examinations; both FCM and cytology were positive in 38 instances, and carcinoma was confirmed by biopsy in 35 (92.1%). In 16 instances FCM and cytology were negative, but carcinoma was present on biopsy in 5 (31.3%). Three examinations were suspicious by both techniques. The 46 determinations with discordant FCM and cytology were subdivided into pathologically confirmed recurrences (25 instances) and no evidence of pathologic and/or cystoscopic disease (21 instances). In the 25 instances of recurrences, FCM was positive in 18 (72.0%), suspicious in 3 (12.0%), and negative in 4 (16.0%), while cytology was positive in 3 (12.0%), suspicious in 9 (36.0%), and negative in 13 (52.0%). Most patients had a severe BCG-induced inflammatory response that caused an elevation of the hyperdiploid population, believed secondary to epithelial regeneration and proliferation. In the 21 instances without detectable recurrence, hyperploidy led to a relatively high proportion of positive (15) and suspicious (4) results by FCM, but only eight had distinct aneuploid populations. It is possible that this latter group, at least, is harboring occult carcinoma. Conventional cytology in the nonrecurrent group was positive in 1 (4.8%), suspicious in 7 (33.3%), and negative in 13 (61.9%). In those instances when tumor was confirmed by biopsy, the false-negative rate for FCM was 19.7%; the false-negative rate for cytology was 40.9%. Thus, FCM appears to be more sensitive but less specific than conventional cytology, having a lower false-negative but a higher false-positive rate. Although serial FCM provides an objective quantitative measure of aneuploid stemlines and hyperdiploid populations in bladder irrigation specimens and can be helpful in following intravesical BCG therapy for superficial bladder carcinoma, it should still be used with conventional cytology. The greatest difficulty with FCM at present, as with conventional cytology, is in cases of marked inflammation. The results reported here were obtained under the most stringent conditions and represent the minimum level of accuracy. Potential improvements in the technique, with the addition of immunologic or other markers, hold hope of further increasing the accuracy of FCM.',\n",

Even in disorders that primarily affect the left ventricle, the once-considered-passive conduit has proved essential for maintenance of normal cardiac output. In coronary artery disease, the function of the right ventricle is affected by both its circulation and the after-load placed on it by dysfunction of the left ventricle. In congestive heart failure, right ventricular function relates to functional capacity, whereas left ventricular function does not, and right ventricular ejection fraction is a useful prognostic guide in these patients. In mitral and aortic valvular disease, the role of the right ventricle is only now becoming evident, and the precise interplay of all factors has yet to be explained.

Little information is available regarding disproportionate dysfunction of the right ventricle associated with cardiac operation and the recovery period therefrom. Recognition of the problem is of paramount importance, if support measures are to be implemented. A great deal has yet to be learned regarding the appropriate support for the acutely failing right ventricle. Much remains to be accomplished regarding the assessment of right ventricle reserve, defining the role of risk factors, and quantitating the value of measures to optimally protect the right ventricle from injury during the perioperative period. Recognizing that the integrity of the right ventricle can be altered by numerous preoperative, perioperative and postoperative factors will provide an enlightened disposition on the part of the surgical team. Awareness of these considerations in the planning and conduct of surgical procedures should reduce morbidity and mortality from perioperative right ventricular failure. The imposition of new or unexpected morbidity during operation on a relatively unrelated problem represents surgical imperfection. Appropriate effort toward minimizing insult of the right ventricle could result in significantly decreasing the incidence and severity of perioperative right ventricular failure before the impetus of the continuing clinical problem dictates improvement in techniques to more appropriately treat this frequently preventable problem.',\n",

Infusion of pulmonary vasodilators--particularly low-dose nitroprusside--should be used if the pulmonary vascular resistance is elevated. If pulmonary blood flow remains unsatisfactory, systemic intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be employed. In refractory cases, right-atrial-to-pulmonary-artery bypass using the Bio-Medicus centrifugal pump is the recommended therapy for those centers that do not have the Pierce-Donachy pneumatic ventricular assist-pump available. For refractory right ventricular failure following the surgical repair of congenital cardiac defects in which the placement of right atrial and pulmonary artery cannulae is not technically feasible, use of high-frequency high-volume ventilation appears to be quite promising. Utilization of pulmonary artery counterpulsation or the creation of an atrial septal defect may also be lifesaving, but is not recommended as the therapy of choice.',\n",
       " '87051560': 'RV and LV failure frequently coexist. Experimental evidence suggests that RV failure results from a primary insult to the right ventricle and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. LV failure results in an elevation of the left atrial pressure and thereby a reduction in the transpulmonary hydrostatic gradient. Because RV function depends on the contraction of the left ventricle, this contribution is reduced during LV failure. Treatment should be aimed first at restoring LV function. If RV failure persists and is not due to a simple mechanical problem, treatment of RV failure should be commenced. If volume loading, inotropes, and pH adjustments do not result in adequate RV output, a mechanical assist device should be considered. RHBP is the most powerful device, and it is capable of restoring systemic perfusion even when there is no residual RV function. Clinical results with this device have been most encouraging--most patients demonstrate improved RV function and a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance after several days of treatment, allowing them to be weaned from assist. However, this technique is very invasive and requires constant close attention. PABC is a simple but less powerful assist device. Experimental studies suggest that if RV function is not extremely depressed--cardiac output is greater than 50 percent of normal--PABC may be effective in restoring systemic perfusion to normal levels. Current results suggest that RHBP remains the gold standard for severe RV failure, but further clinical experience with PABC may more clearly define its role in the management of RV failure.',\n",

Vessel edges were measured by use of catheter calibration and an automated computer algorithm yielding two \"absolute dimensions\" (mean and minimum diameters) and two measurements (percent stenosis and atheroma area) that required a \"normal reference\" diameter. The coefficient of variation for repeated segment measurements was less for mean and minimum diameter than for percent stenosis and area of atheroma. The best measure of progression of coronary disease as determined by t test comparison of different methods was the change in mean diameter over time (6.7 +/- 14.1% decrease), whether calculated on a per coronary segment or per patient basis (p less than .001).

However, no large additional muscular defects were missed by imaging and color Doppler. Color Doppler is useful for the detection of ventricular septal defects and has higher sensitivity than two-dimensional/Doppler for multiple ventricular septal defects. The contribution of color Doppler appears to be in the detection of additional small muscular ventricular septal defects.',\n",

The latter had old myocardial infarction and no conduction disturbances and had not been receiving antiarrhythmic drugs. In both normal subjects and patients with VT, isopotential maps of the time-averaged and filtered (25 Hz high-pass) electrocardiograms during the terminal portion of the QRS were dipolar, i.e., they showed single positive and negative regions. For patients with VT, the extrema were either distant, with one over the precordial area and the other over the back, or close together in the precordial region. In 10 patients, maps recorded after administration of antiarrhythmic drugs remained the same while QRS duration was prolonged. In six patients, maps recorded before antiarrhythmic surgery showed distant extrema for septal or posterobasal VT sites of origin and close extrema for anterior or posteroapical sites. Generally, QRS duration was reduced and maps were modified after surgery. Late potentials can be well detected with only three orthogonal leads because their distributions are dipolar, but maps provide additional information about their distribution, which may be related to conduction delay sites and possibly to VT sites of origin. Sources near the torso surface would produce close extrema, whereas deeper sources would produce distant extrema.',\n",

Potential time integrals of the QRST and ST-T intervals were calculated at each lead point and displayed as isointegral (ISOI) maps. The main abnormalities noted on the QRST and ST-T ISOI maps were one area of negative values larger than normal in the right anterior and inferior thorax and a complex multipeak distribution of the integral values. At least one abnormality was present in 19 (76%) of the patients with LQTS and four (16%) of the control subjects (p less than .001). Each ISOI map was also represented as a weighted sum of nine fundamental components (eigenvectors) to detect and quantitate the nondipolar content. The percent contribution of the nondipolar eigenvectors (all eigenvectors beyond the third) was significantly higher in the LQTS group than in the control group (p less than .005). Specifically, an abnormally high nondipolar content on the QRST ISOI maps was observed much more frequently for patients with LQTS than for control subjects (nine or 36% vs one or 4%), and this was also true on the ST-T ISOI maps (14 or 56% vs one or 4%). No correlation was found between the major abnormalities on body surface maps and syncopal episodes. However, the high prevalence (76%) of these alterations among the patients with LQTS and their infrequent occurrence in the control population strongly suggests that they may be useful markers for the diagnosis of atypical cases. The prominent electronegative area on the anterior thorax can be related to delayed repolarization of a portion of the anterior wall of the heart. This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that lower than normal right cardiac sympathetic activity is the main pathogenetic mechanism of LQTS. Multipeak distribution and high nondipolar content suggest regional electrical disparities in the ventricular recovery process. This may in part account for the high susceptibility of patients with LQTS to malignant arrhythmias.',\n",
       " '87052065': 'Guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia by preoperative endocardial catheter mapping necessitates improvement of the accuracy of localization of the arrhythmogenic site. We therefore used a new mathematical cineradiographic method during catheter mapping to compute the position of left ventricular arrhythmogenic sites relative to three anatomic reference points: the centers of aortic and mitral valve ostia and the left ventricular apex. To enable the surgeon to identify the position of the computed sites, a wire skeleton (one for each patient) representing a single or multiple arrhythmogenic site(s) relative to the anatomic reference points was constructed. This wire skeleton was inserted into the left ventricular cavity during surgery. Side branches of the device indicated preoperatively localized arrhythmogenic sites. Results in eight consecutive patients were compared with those of intraoperative simultaneous mapping of 64 endocardial sites. Sixteen morphologically distinct monomorphic ventricular tachycardias were mapped by catheter and 15 by intraoperative mapping. In 12 ventricular tachycardias an identical morphology was recorded during both techniques. The distance between arrhythmogenic sites localized with both methods was 1 cm or less in 11 of these 12 ventricular tachycardias and 2 cm in one ventricular tachycardia. These results indicate that endocardial catheter mapping combined with wire skeleton representation of computed positions of arrhythmogenic sites is reliable for guiding surgical therapy of ventricular tachycardia and since some of the ventricular tachycardias were inducible only during either preoperative or intraoperative mapping, both techniques have an additive value. In addition, the wire skeleton proved convenient during surgery by identifying the arrhythmogenic sites.',\n",

QRS duration during incremental ventricular pacing was used as an index of rate-dependent changes in intraventricular conduction. The mean plasma procainamide concentrations corresponding to the incremental doses were 5.5 +/- 1.2 (+/- SD), 9.0 +/- 1.6, 12.6 +/- 2.2, and 16.3 +/- 3.2 mg/liter. Each incremental dose of procainamide up to a dose of 30 mg/kg resulted in a significant increment in right ventricular effective refractory period and each dose up to 22.5 mg/kg potentiated a rate-dependent prolongation of QRS duration. After the 7.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in eight of 31 patients. After higher doses of procainamide, induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed in two additional patients. In three of 10 patients in whom the induction of ventricular tachycardia was suppressed by 7.5, 15, or 22.5 mg/kg of procainamide, sustained unimorphic ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after a higher dose of procainamide. In three of 31 patients, only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible after a 7.5 to 22.5 mg/kg dose of procainamide; however, in two of these three patients, sustained ventricular tachycardia was again inducible after administration of a higher dose of procainamide. In conclusion, during electropharmacologic testing with procainamide, it is worthwhile to test a dose of 7.5 mg/kg, because this dose is often effective in patients who respond to this drug. However, the results of this study indicate that procainamide may be effective in suppressing the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia at a relatively low plasma concentration, but not at a higher plasma concentration. Therefore, during long-term therapy with procainamide it may be important to avoid plasma procainamide concentrations not only lower, but also higher than the concentration that results in the suppression of induction of tachycardia.',\n",

Stenosis morphology before angioplasty was considered \"complicated\" if at least one of the following criteria was present: irregular borders, intraluminal lucency, and localization of stenosis in curve or at bifurcation. Baseline characteristics, maximum inflation pressures, types of balloon catheters used, and routinely registered angiographic stenosis properties (severity, length, eccentricity, and calcification) were similar in both groups. Irregular borders before PTCA were present in 22 of 38 patients in group I vs 10 of 38 in group II (p less than .05), intraluminal lucency in 22 of 38 vs nine of 38 (p less than .05), localization in curve in 27 of 38 pts vs 16 of 38 (p less than .05), and localization at bifurcation in 11 of 38 vs 15 of 38 (NS).

Augmentation of intrathoracic pressure by high-pressure ventilation simultaneous with compression of the chest in dogs has been shown to produce higher flows to the heart and brain, but has limited usefulness because of the requirement for endotracheal intubation and complex devices. A system was developed that can produce high intrathoracic pressure without simultaneous ventilation by use of a pneumatically cycled vest placed around the thorax (vest cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]). The system was first tested in a short-term study of the maximum achievable flows during arrest. Peak vest pressures up to 380 mm Hg were used on eight 21 to 30 kg dogs after induction of ventricular fibrillation and administration of epinephrine. Microsphere-determined myocardial blood flow was 108 +/- 17 ml/min/100 g (100 +/- 16% of prearrest flow) and cerebral flow was 51 +/- 12 ml/min/100 g (165 +/- 39% of prearrest). Severe lung or liver trauma was noted in three of eight dogs. If peak vest pressure was limited to 280 mm Hg, however, severe trauma was no longer observed.

Six dogs were instrumented with electromagnetic flow probes and subendocardial ultrasonic crystals. Intracoronary injections of iohexol (300 mg/ml iodine) were administered to establish a relationship between the dose and rate of contrast injection and the effect on flow and regional myocardial function. Two and 4 ml volumes of iohexol were injected at 3 ml/sec; 4 ml volumes were administered at 1 and 4 ml/sec. The 2 and 4 ml volumes decreased coronary flow by a mean of 31% (p less than .01) and 77% (p less than .001). The 4 ml injection at 1 and 4 ml/sec 77% (p less than .001) and 69% (p less than .001). The magnitude of the fall in flow was directly related to the dose, and the rate at which the flow nadir was attained was directly related to the rate of injection. Decrements in fractional shortening were temporally delayed by several beats compared with the flow changes and showed mean decrements of 19% to 29%.

After 48 hr the surviving animals were killed and measurements were made of the risk region (by postmortem angiography) and infarct size (by gross pathology). All measurements were made by investigators blinded to treatment given, and the code was broken only at the end of the study. Hemodynamic variables and collateral flow during ischemia were similar in the two groups. Infarct size in control animals (n = 8) averaged 22.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle and 52.2 +/- 7.1% of the risk region, compared with 13.3 +/- 0.8% of the left ventricle and 33.6 +/- 2.1% of the risk region in h-SOD-treated dogs (n = 8) (p less than .05). Infarcts in treated animals were not only smaller, but also exhibited a distinctive \"patchiness,\" suggesting protection along vascular distributions. Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between infarct size and collateral flow measured during ischemia in the two groups indicated that protection by h-SOD was greatest in animals with the lowest collateral flows. This study supports the concept that reperfusion of ischemic myocardium results in a separate component of cell damage, presumably linked to the generation of oxygen free radicals on reflow. Since the h-SOD preventable reperfusion component of injury was most pronounced in hearts with the most severe ischemia, scavenging of oxygen radicals at the time of reflow may offer a novel and particularly promising therapeutic approach for the protection of ischemic myocardium.',\n",

Because coughing during cardiac arrest has been shown to produce adequate anterograde flow to maintain consciousness in man without compressing the heart, cough CPR has been used as a model of a pure \"thoracic pump\" mechanism on which to base modifications of CPR. In the thoracic pump mechanism, the left heart is a passive conduit for blood expressed from the pulmonary vasculature to the aorta, and there is selective flow to the brachiocephalic vascular bed because of its low pressure veins, which are protected by closure of thoracic inlet venous valves. Right heart flow from systemic veins to the lungs occurs between applications of pressure. Four alternative modalities exploiting the thoracic pump concept were studied in dogs during ventricular fibrillation with angiographic and pressure recordings: cough CPR, simultaneous chest compression and lung inflation, abdominal compression with lung inflation, and inflation of a vest and binder.

The parents of 154 children were asked about the age, sex, birthweight, method of postnatal feeding and age at starting school or day nursery of the child, the frequency of sore throats, smoking habits and history of tonsillectomy of all members of the household, the size of family, the dwelling size, and the occupation of the father. Analysis by multiple regression showed a significant association between children's sore throats and maternal smoking. Reduction in domestic cigarette smoke exposure should benefit the child by reducing the number of sore throats he or she suffers.\",\n",

Different events were photographed by taking 'stills' from the television monitor during play-back. Outgrowths from both tumour and normal explants formed only as monolayers. Mitoses were mainly found to be localized approximately mid-way between explant and the edge of the outgrowth. Some cells were seen to become suddenly active producing oscillating blebs and sometimes they detached themselves from the monolayer culture and changed appearance. This was more prevalent in the tumour cultures. In both tumour and normal cell cultures lymphocytes were observed and their normal chemokinetic movement was changed into a rapid chemotactic attraction by the presence of a mitotic epithelial cell. These lymphocytes appear to represent T-suppressor cells. The present study has shown that primary tissue culture can be a valuable tool in the study of laryngeal carcinoma. The interaction between mitotic tumour cells and lymphocytes may represent a transformation of T-lymphocytes into LAK cells.\",\n",

We have carried out a study of the fine structure of the respiratory nasal mucosa in man and in the cat using the techniques described by Jabonero, Champy Maillet and Koelle-Friedenwald. The most striking finding was the presence of microganglia deep within the mucosa of the inferior turbinate close to the glands. These microganglia were cholinergic in nature since they demonstrated a positive reaction to anticholinesterase. From this we deduce that the nasal parasympathetic pathway has its postganglionic neurones not only in the pterygopalatine ganglion but also in these microganglia of the inferior turbinate. Each of four groups of cats were submitted to different techniques, including administration of neostigmine, inferior turbinectomy and Vidian neurectomy. Resection of the microganglia by means of turbinectomy reduced the hypersecretion caused by neostigmine and this was most noticeable when a Vidian neurectomy was carried out in addition.',\n",

Evidence of stem bending was present on examination of the femoral implant, and marked wear of the acetabular cup was noted. The pathologic evaluation of removed calcar bone and cement revealed a histiocytic mass invading the bone. Intracellular and extracellular polymethylene debris was noted within the invasive mass. Evidence of fragmented methylmethacrylate cement was also present. The bone-cement interface in the excised calcar region contained segments that showed active bone remodelling around the cement without an interposed membrane. It is possible that this case of calcar resorption began with histiocytic activation and recruitment by polyethylene wear debris followed by active bone lysis. The process may be perpetuated by the fragmentation of cement, as motion occurred at the calcar bone-cement interface, and may represent an extreme example of a process occurring in cases of calcar resorption in general.',\n",

A stochastic model was set up to investigate the predictions of current BMU theory. Each of 100 trabecular \"thicknesses\" was drawn from the appropriate normal distribution using a pseudorandom number generator. Each day, each of its two surfaces when quiescent was assumed to have a 1:900 chance of initiating a remodelling cycle. Resorption (active, 12 days; reversal phase, 27 days) was followed by formation (94 +/- 35 days) and resulted in BMU balance when resorption depth was 36.8 +/- 9.2 micron. Fenestration (thickness less than 0) was assumed to lead to permanent loss of the trabecula. The original model unrealistically increased its mean trabecular thickness as thin trabeculae were lost. This was corrected by assuming that thin trabeculae had greater osteoblastic stimulation and a consequent tendency to thicken, perhaps due to higher mechanical loading. Over 20 years, 14% of trabeculae were lost when the BMU balance was exact and the distribution of trabecular thicknesses was unchanged. About one-half of fenestrations were due to deeper-than-average resorption cavities developing in thin trabeculae, and the remainder to coincident remodelling on both surfaces. A 10% fall in osteoblast lifespan resulted in an additional 36.7% loss of trabecular bone volume and mean trabecular thickness fell to 83.1 micron, compatible with Courpron\\'s data. Simulating more rapid mechanisms of bone loss, approximately 50% of trabeculae could be lost after ten years by the arrest of bone formation; the doubling of resorption depth with unchanged bone formation; and a doubling in the rate of initiation of new BMUs with unchanged bone formation rate, all three followed by complete recovery of BMU balance after only two years. In each case, mean trabecular thickness fell only transiently but trabeculae continued to be lost after recovery.

Curettage of the radial lesion and packing it initially with autogenous iliac bone graft and subsequently with methylmethacrylate bone cement were followed by local recurrences. The radial lesion eventually was eradicated by a segmental resection of the distal radius. The resulting bony defect was bridged with a bicortical autogenous iliac graft and stabilized with a bone plate to produce a painless solid wrist fusion. No further tumor recurrence has been noted for the past two years.',\n",
       " '87052444': 'Osteoarthrosis is a physiologic imbalance, a \"joint failure\" similar to \"heart failure,\" in which mechanical factors play a role. The initiation and progression of cartilage damage are distinct phenomena. One of the mechanisms of initiation may be a steep stiffness gradient in the underlying subchondral bone. Progression of cartilage lesions probably requires stiffened subchondral bone. In such situations, transverse stresses at the base of the articular cartilage could cause deep horizontal splits in that tissue. The most likely cause of subchondral stiffening in an otherwise congruent joint is repeated failure of the musculoskeletal peak dynamic force attenuation mechanisms. The health and integrity of the overlying articular cartilage depends on the mechanical properties of its bony bed. In certain models of osteoarthrosis, alterations of the bony bed occur before the cartilage changes and suggest that this can occur in clinical conditions. Stiffening of the subchondral bone also can effect joint conformation, which involves deformation of articular cartilage and bone to create maximum contact areas under load.',\n",
       " '87052446': 'Although osteoarthritis (OA) generally is considered a disorder of mechanical origin, the common occurrence of chronic mononuclear cell infiltrates in the synovium in conjunction with immunofluorescent evidence for immune-reactant products in cartilage of surgical case specimens (knees, hips, and peripheral joints) has suggested the local involvement of immune processes in the arthritis. Further, the findings of polyarthropathy in the majority of these cases have indicated the propensity for a systemic disorder. Wide variations were noted in both synovial and cartilage immune changes, quite different to those found in rheumatoid arthritis, along with the frequent asymptomatology of the many joints involved. These features, with and without other causative factors, suggest that immune reactions of local and/or systemic origin occur at times in a population at risk for joint degradation.',\n",
       " '87052450': 'Clinical and laboratory observations suggest that a relationship exists between sex hormones and the development of osteoarthritis. The mechanisms whereby these hormones influence the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis have been explored. Tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, reduced erosive changes in meniscectomy-induced osteoarthritis in rabbits. By contrast, estradiol worsened it. There was no effect of either agent on the incidence of osteophytes in this model. Both estradiol and tamoxifen affected proteoglycan, prostaglandin, and proteoglycanase production by cartilage components. These observations suggest that cartilage is a sex hormone-sensitive tissue. This may have therapeutic implications in the future.',\n",
       " '87052451': 'It is clear that some synovial inflammation occurs in joints affected by osteoarthritis (OA) and it is well recognized that many patients with OA experience a decrease in pain and joint stiffness following administration of salicylates or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, neither the extent to which synovitis contributes to the cartilage breakdown in OA nor the effects of chronic administration of NSAIDs on the natural history of OA in humans is known. Recent studies indicate that several NSAIDs, including salicylates, suppress proteoglycan synthesis in articular cartilage in vitro. The effect on OA cartilage is more marked than that on normal cartilage. Other studies show that salicylate feeding may suppress proteoglycan metabolism in degenerating cartilage in vivo, aggravating the decrease in proteoglycan content caused by the disease itself. However, no effect of salicylates on normal articular cartilage has been observed in vivo. In damaged cartilage the magnitude of NSAID-induced suppression of proteoglycan metabolism appears to be related inversely to the proteoglycan content of the tissue. In addition, the NSAIDs used in treatment of arthritis today may differ with respect to their in vivo effects on articular cartilage metabolism due, in part, to differences between the molar concentrations of these drugs in synovial fluid.',\n",

Objective (tracking, divided attention, Maddox wing, etc.) and subjective (visual analogue scales and questionnaires) tests were done before and twice after single oral doses. Diazepam (0.15 and 0.30 mg/kg) impaired performance dose relatedly and rendered the subjects drowsy, calm, mentally slow, and clumsy. Buspirone (15 mg) proved inactive in objective tests but matched diazepam (0.30 mg/kg) subjectively.

It appeared that sensitization to cobalt in cement occurs only secondarily to an existing cement dermatitis. 1.8% (5/272) workers had nickel sensitivity: 2 with allergic contact dermatitis to nickel in their watches, 2 were asymptomatic and 1 had allergic contact dermatitis to chromate and cobalt in cement. The low prevalence of cobalt and nickel sensitivity from cement was probably related to the low concentration of soluble cobalt and nickel salts in the cement. However, these insoluble salts can form soluble complexes with body fluids on eczematous skin and sensitize the skin.',\n",

A highly sensitive electrochemical method was used to quantify the amount of nickel permeating the skin. The investigations show that nickel ions are capable of permeating the skin barrier when applied under occlusion. The process is slow, having a lag time of approximately 50 h. The permeation rate, and thus the physical amount being bioavailable, is considerably increased when aqueous nickel chloride is used in comparison with aqueous nickel sulphate.

Therefore, we determined the effects of administering high-dose dopamine (more than 20 micrograms/kg X min) on the urine output of 15 newborn infants. Five infants were studied prospectively and ten retrospectively. In the prospective study, urine output was determined as the dose of dopamine was increased; in the retrospective study, urine output was determined as the infants were being weaned from high doses of dopamine. Both data sets demonstrate that administering high-dosage dopamine does not reduce the urine output of sick newborn infants. Therefore, we conclude that doses of dopamine previously reported to decrease urine output in adults do not do so in sick newborn infants. Consequently, when necessary, high doses of dopamine may be used in sick newborn infants to achieve cardiovascular stability without reducing urine output.',\n",

Overt phlebitis or inflammation around the site was 14 times as common with peripheral catheters (353/1,024) than with centrally inserted central catheters (18/713), even though peripheral catheters were removed on the average at 2.9 days and centrally inserted central catheters at 6.2 days.

The purpose of this study was to examine the range of mid-vital capacity flow ratios in a group of healthy subjects and to determine if some of the variability is accounted for by different maximum inspiratory pressures. We measured maximum expiratory and inspiratory flows at 50 percent of vital capacity from the flow-volume curves, and maximum inspiratory pressures in a group of 60 healthy nonsmokers (30 men and 30 women) whose ages ranged from 21 to 40 years. We found that mid-vital capacity flow ratio (mean +/- SD) was 0.72 +/- 0.19 in men and 0.77 +/- 0.18 in women. The coefficient of variation of the mid-vital capacity flow ratio was 28 percent for men and 23 percent for women.

None of the treatments prevented ovulation. However, the combination of drugs inhibited subsequent function of the corpus luteum (CL) as assessed by serum measurements of progesterone. Administration of antihistamines did not alter pituitary secretion of LH. Injection of small quantities of diphenhydramine and cimetidine into the antrum of the preovulatory follicle also caused aberrant luteal activity, but no blockade of ovulation. Intrafollicular injection of histamine reversed the inhibitory influence of antihistamines on the CL. Antihistamines suppressed preovulatory thecal edema and antral influx of plasma transudate containing LH. Thus, the effects of antihistamines appear to have been exerted at the follicular level. Function of matured CL was not compromised by peripheral administration of antihistamines. Actions of histamine within the preovulatory ovine follicle do not appear to be a prerequisite for ovulation, but apparently do have an impact on ensuing luteal function. We propose that a hyperemic reaction to histamine in preovulatory follicles enhances vascular filtration of LH. As a consequence, maximal permeation of the avascular granulosal layer of the follicle by LH leads to a normal luteinization response.',\n",
       " '87053545': 'To determine the effect of decidualization on uterine immunoglobulins (Igs), we measured the levels of IgG, IgA, and secretory component (SC) after induction of artificial decidual cell reactions (DCR) in hormonally primed ovariectomized rats. When progesterone-treated (2.5 mg/day, 3 days) rats received an intraluminal instillation of oil or a needle scratch stimulation in one uterine horn, the stimulated horn had an increase in wet weight and cytoplasmic protein relative to the contralateral horn. Under these conditions, IgG levels increased 10-fold in the lumen of the stimulated horn. This response was selective for IgG, because induction of DCR had no effect on accumulation of IgA or SC in the stimulated horn. The progesterone-induced accumulation of IgG after DCR was further enhanced by estradiol. The addition of a small amount of estradiol (0.2 microgram) on day 3 of a 4-day progesterone pretreatment resulted in further increases in both the wet weight of the stimulated horn and the concentration of IgG in the lumen. The amount of IgG in the lumen of the stimulated horn was 5-fold greater than that in the stimulated horn after progesterone alone. Levels of IgA and SC, however, remained unchanged with this treatment. These results indicate that movement of IgG into the uterine lumen occurs as a part of the DCR and that both an appropriate endocrine balance and physical stimulation are essential for maximal IgG accumulation. Further, they suggest that IgG may play a central role in early pregnancy, which results in the successful implantation of the blastocysts.',\n",
       " '87053547': 'The purpose of this study was to determine whether the availability of PRL modulates the chloride concentration of human sweat. Full thickness human skin grafted into the back of immunoincompetent, nude, congenitally athymic mice heals in about 6 to 10 weeks and survives the life of the mice. Mice have no sweat glands in the back so this system provides a useful model for study of the physiology and pathology of human sweat glands. The graft can be induced to sweat and the sweat collected for analytical studies. Presumably normal skin obtained from 7 individuals undergoing reconstructive surgery was grafted successfully into 11 mice. On 49 occasions sweat was induced by pilocarpine iontophoresis and collected for 45 min. The chloride concentration was 12.9 +/- 6.7 meq/liter, values typical of normal human sweat. Nine mice bearing grafts were injected with rabbit anti-human PRL (hPRL). The chloride concentration of sweat obtained a day later was significantly elevated. The concentration generally increased after a second and sometimes a third injection of anti-PRL. The average maximum sweat chloride obtained was 61.9 +/- 8.25 meq/liter. Serum of rabbits that had not been exposed to hPRL was prepared and diluted in the same way as the anti-hPRL. The chloride concentration of sweat of 3 mice that received the preparation for several days remained unchanged at the low normal level. We conclude that depletion of PRL increases the concentration of chloride in human sweat.',\n",

We used Silastic implants filled with either estradiol (E2) or progesterone (P) to treat spayed animals for 14 days with E2 followed by 14 days of E2 plus P. We then withdrew the P (but not the E2) implants and removed uteri 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 14 days later. Uterine tissues were assayed biochemically for ER content, fixed for histology and frozen for immunocytochemistry of ER with monoclonal antiestrophilins. On day 0, ER levels in endometrium were low [1330 +/- 201 (n = 9) fmol/mg DNA]. An increase in total receptor was evident by 3-4 days of P withdrawal 2762 +/- 190 (n = 6) fmol/mg DNA; P less than 0.001]. Total receptor concentrations increased linearly with time from 0.5-7 days of P withdrawal (r = 0.88). On day 0, staining for nuclear ER in the glandular epithelium and stroma of zones I, II, and III of the endometrium was negative. Beginning at 12-24 h and continuing through 4 days of P withdrawal, nuclear staining became detectable and increased in intensity only in endometrial stromal fibroblasts and myometrial smooth muscle cells. The glandular epithelium of the endometrium did not develop nuclear staining until 5-7 days of P withdrawal, coincident with a 10-fold increase in the mitotic index of the epithelium of the upper zones. Thus, the increase in endometrial ER levels that occurred during the first 5 days of an induced luteal-follicular transition took place almost exclusively in stromal fibroblasts.',\n",

The relative amounts of 9 K CaBP messenger RNA (mRNA) were assayed by dot-blot hybridization and the relative amounts of 9 K CaBP by RIA. Both inhibitors were injected at doses which significantly inhibited by 80-95% [35S]methionine or [3H]uridine incorporation into protein and RNA, respectively. In vitamin D-deficient rats, a single 1,25(OH)2D3 injection (650 pmol/100 g BW) resulted in a rapid production of 9 K CaBP mRNA which was significantly detectable as early as 3 h, and was followed by an increase of 9 K CaBP levels. Injection of actinomycin D (25 micrograms/100 g BW) 1 h before 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment and repeated every 4 h did not prevent the hormone-induced elevation of duodenal CaBP mRNA, even when the actinomycin dose was doubled and given 2 h before hormonal treatment. alpha-Amanitin (2 micrograms/100 g BW) also failed to block the hormonal stimulation. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (25 micrograms/100 g BW) did not cause any change in the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced CaBP mRNA but blocked the CaBP increase after hormone injection. Thus, transcription inhibitors did not prevent the in vivo hormone-induced elevation of 9 K CaBP mRNA, which suggests that 1,25(OH)2D3 increases 9 K CaBP synthesis by increasing 9 K CaBP gene expression at one or more posttranscriptional steps. More precise data will be obtained by measuring the rate of 9 K CaBP gene transcription on isolated nuclei from rat duodenum.',\n",
       " '87053554': 'The effect of 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta E2) on anterior pituitary dopaminergic receptor (D2) content was studied in vitro in relation to PRL secretion. Anterior pituitaries from ovariectomized rats were incubated for short periods in medium 199, with or without the steroid. Dopamine (DA) receptors in partially purified pituitary membranes were quantified by equilibrium binding using [3H]spiperone; the PRL released into the incubation medium was analyzed by RIA. Addition of 10(-10) to 10(-6) M 17 beta E2 to the incubation medium of anterior pituitaries rapidly and reversibly decreased the number of DA receptors (P less than 0.01 to 0.001), while increasing PRL release, in a dose-related fashion. The maximal effect on both receptor numbers and PRL secretion was obtained with 10(-8) M 17 beta E2. This effect involved no change in receptor affinity (Kd = 0.11 +/- 0.01 nM in presence or in absence of 17 beta E2). This estrogen-induced decrease in DA-binding capacity was apparently not the result of the occupation of spiperone binding sites by the steroid, since after a 30-min incubation with 10(-8) M [3H]17 beta E2, no radioactivity was detectable on the partially purified membranes. Moreover, the presence of 17 beta E2 at the same time as the labeled D2 ligand did not modify the kinetics of association or dissociation of spiperone with pituitary membranes. This decrease in anterior pituitary DA receptor content and the increase in PRL release were already significant after a 7-min incubation in the presence of 10(-8) M 17 beta E2. Finally, these effects of 17 beta E2 were not mimicked by its 17 alpha-stereoisomer, nor by progesterone, or testosterone. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of 17 beta E2 on PRL secretion may be due, at least in part, to the desensitization of anterior pituitary cells to DA. The steroid may produce this desensitization directly by decreasing the number of D2. The short latency of this effect likely discards the possibility of a genomic action of 17 beta E2.',\n",
       " '87053555': 'Surgically prepared cryptorchid mouse testes containing only type A spermatogonia were cultured with (Bu)2cAMP in combination with vitamin A (retinol). Treatment with (Bu)2cAMP and retinol for 12-24 h and with basal medium for an additional 8 days stimulated mitotic activity in type A spermatogonia and induced differentiation of germ cells. However, (Bu)2cAMP alone did not induce differentiation of type A spermatogonia. Moreover, when cryptorchid testes were treated with (Bu)2cAMP for longer than 3 days in the presence or absence of retinol, differentiation of type A spermatogonia did not take place; disintegration of the seminiferous tubules occurred instead. When the cryptorchid testes were cultured for 24 h in a medium containing a fixed concentration of retinol and varying concentrations of (Bu)2cAMP from 0.001-0.4 mM, there was a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells and type A spermatogonia. Likewise, at a fixed dose of (Bu)2cAMP and increasing concentrations of retinol, a dose-dependent increase in the number of differentiated and mitotic germ cells occurred. However, the number of type A spermatogonia was decreased. The addition of puromycin, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D to the medium completely blocked retinol-(Bu)2cAMP-induced differentiation of the germ cells. The present results suggest that cAMP and retinol trigger biochemical events promoting the synthesis of specific macromolecules involved in the proliferation and differentiation of type A spermatogonia.',\n",

Moreover, immunocytochemical studies suggested an increase in the VIP content in the hypothalamus of lactating rats. We investigated whether this increase is regulated at the level of gene transcription. A sensitive RNA detection assay that uses in vitro transcribed RNA probes corresponding to specific exons of the VIP gene was devised to study VIP gene expression. Using this method, an approximately 2000-base long RNA containing the coding sequences for VIP was detected in rat hypothalamus. This RNA also contains the coding sequences for the VIP-related peptide PHM/I (peptide histidine methionine amide or isoleucine amide). An identical VIP-encoding RNA was previously identified in the rat cerebral cortex. A 2-fold increase was observed in hypothalamic VIP mRNA during lactation. In addition, the levels of this mRNA increased in the hypothalamus at the time of sexual maturation. Taken together, our results suggest a physiological regulation of VIP gene expression associated with its potential role as a neuroendocrine hormone.',\n",
       " '87053562': 'Maternal and fetal rabbit thyroid glands were compared as to their ability to respond to excess iodide in vitro with a reduction in subsequent iodide transport activity. Preincubation of maternal thyroid tissue slices for 2 h with excess iodide (30 microM) resulted in a 31% reduction in the subsequently measured thyroid-medium radioiodide concentration ratio. In contrast, similar iodide pretreatment had no significant effect on fetal iodide transport. In all other respects, fetal iodide transport, although it was 10 times higher, did not differ significantly from maternal transport activity. Combined radiolabeled maternal (125I) and fetal (131I) rabbit thyroid tissue was eluted on Sephadex G-25 columns. Fractions were analyzed for both 125I and 131I activity, and the maternal to fetal ratios (125I/131I) were determined for each fraction. The majority of iodoproteins eluted with the void volume, and the 125I/131I ratio was constant in these fractions. Thereafter, two peaks of elevated 125I/131I activity could be observed. Peak A eluted below lysozyme (Mr = 14,300) and above insulin (Mr = 6,000), with an apparent mol wt of 8,000 to 10,000. A second peak, peak B, eluted from the column at a site similar to that of MIT or a protein of Mr of 2,000. Ascending paper chromatography of this latter peak of 125I/131I activity and MIT was carried out in two solvent systems. In both systems, peak B comigrated with MIT. These findings suggest that the failure of fetal thyroid tissue to exhibit autoregulation may be associated with the reduced iodination of a compound with an approximate Mr of 8,000 to 10,000. The role of this substance in iodide transport remains to be identified. The reason for the apparent increase in the labeling of MIT observed in maternal vs. fetal tissue is unknown.',\n",
       " '87053563': 'The role of protein synthesis in iodide-induced suppression of subsequent iodide transport (iodide autoregulation) was studied in cat thyroid slices. Thyroid slices were pretreated for 60-120 min in the presence or absence of either excess (30 microM) sodium iodide, inhibitors of protein synthesis, or both. Tissue was then washed in the presence of 2 mM methimazole to prevent subsequent iodination reaction and remove excess iodide. Iodide transport activity was finally evaluated by measurement of the ratio of tissue to medium iodide concentrations in 90-min incubations. Addition of 0.1 mM cycloheximide during the preexposure of thyroid tissue to excess iodide had no effect on either control levels of iodide transport or iodide-induced autoregulation. However, if thyroid tissue was treated with cycloheximide alone for 1 h before preexposure to excess iodide, there was a significant reduction in the degree of iodide-induced induced autoregulation. Similar results were obtained with pretreatment of the tissue with 0.5 mM puromycin and 1 microgram/ml emetine. These findings suggest that protein synthesis is involved in the mechanism of thyroid autoregulation of iodide transport. Cycloheximide had no effect on the ability of excess iodide to reduce TSH-stimulated cAMP formation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-isoelectric focusing and Sephadex G-25 column chromatography employing dual-isotope comparison of iodoprotein labeling of control and cycloheximide-treated tissue suggest that the ability of cycloheximide to suppress iodide-induced autoregulation is associated with the reduced iodination of an 8- to 10-kilodalton soluble component of the thyroid gland.',\n",

This increase in enzymatic activity was accompanied by an increase in calmodulin content of the basolateral membrane. Although neither exogenously added calmodulin (up to 10 micrograms/ml) nor calcium (from 10(-7)-10(-5) M) stimulated enzyme activity, calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, W7, and W13 inhibited it. When calmodulin content, adenylate cyclase activity, and alkaline phosphatase activity were measured in cells sequentially eluted from the tip to the base of the villus, cells from the midregion and base had the highest calmodulin content and adenylate cyclase activity, whereas alkaline phosphatase activity (a brush border membrane enzyme) was highest in cells eluted from the tip. Adenylate cyclase activity was increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3, particularly in cells from the midvillus. Our results indicate that the response of adenylate cyclase activity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 varies along the villus and suggest that calmodulin may be involved.',\n",

Animals infused with 1,25-(OH)2D3 exhibited mild hypercalcemia (11.2 vs. 10.2 mg/dl in controls), a 136% increase in the serum concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (187 vs. 79 pg/ml), and a 59% decrease in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (12 vs. 29 ng/ml).

Similar but less striking changes were seen in the lumbar vertebra. Increases in the fat-free weight and calcium content of the tibia and lumbar vertebra were consistent with the increase in trabecular bone volume after 1,25-(OH)2D3 infusion. However, tetracycline labeling and the incorporation of 45Ca in these bones were reduced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 infusion. In addition, mineralization lag time was prolonged in the lumbar vertebrae of 1,25-(OH)2D3-infused rats.

       " '87053570': 'We examined the mechanism underlying the rapid (15-120 min) glucocorticoid-mediated increase in the synthesis of proteins envisioned as mediators of the initial steroid effects in thymic lymphocytes. Analysis of about 1500 in vitro translation products on giant two-dimensional gels revealed rapid hormonal influences on only 7 mRNAs, 6 whose translation products have mol wt and pIs identical to those proteins whose synthesis has been found to be increased after the addition of glucocorticoids to thymus cells. The additional mRNA codes for glucocortin, whose induction in thymus as well as other target cells has been reported. mRNA inductions for proteins 1, 2, and 1N are detectable 15-30 min after the addition of dexamethasone to isolated thymus cells and continue to increase until 2 h, whereas the mRNAs for proteins 4 and 5 are not increased until after 1 h. The mRNA for protein 3 is elevated by 1 h, but attempts to quantitate the change at earlier times have failed because this protein focuses poorly. The parallel between these in vitro translation results and the increased synthesis of individual proteins seen in whole cells demonstrates that increased mRNA levels underlie the cellular changes. Other hormones, such as estradiol, testosterone, and T3, at 10(-6) M and deoxycorticosterone at 10(-8) M do not induce these messages. Partial inductions of 1 and 2, but not 1N, are seen with deoxycorticosterone at 10(-6) M, consistent with its classification as a partial glucocorticoid agonist. Cycloheximide does not block the rise in mRNA for the most rapid inductions, 1, 2, and 1N. The results indicate that dexamethasone rapidly and specifically induces 6 thymus cell mRNAs in addition to the one coding for glucocortin. The cycloheximide results suggest that at least 3 of these represent primary steroid hormone responses.',\n",

       " '87053572': '17 beta-Estradiol (E2) affects the sensitivity of pituitary cells to several neurohormones as LHRH, TRH, or dopamine, presumably by modulating receptor coupling mechanisms. We attempted to pinpoint the membrane processes underlying this modulation and studied the effect of E2 on pituitary membrane phospholipid methylation. Anterior pituitary membranes prepared from ovariectomized (ovx) or ovx plus E2-treated rats were assayed for phospholipid methylation. Methylated phospholipids were separated by TLC. Incorporation of [3H]methyl groups into phospholipids increased with membrane concentration and incubation time with S-adenosyl-L-methyl [3H]methionine; it was not Mg2+ dependent and was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, methyltransferase inhibitor. pH was found to be critical. Formation of phosphatidyl-monoethanolamine, phosphatidyl-dimethylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine was markedly stimulated by treatment with E2. The effect increased progressively when animals were killed 15 h to 5 days after E2 implantation. The response involved a shift in the maximum velocity (Vmax) although there was no change in the available substrate for the methylating enzyme. This change in Vmax probably reflects changes in the amount of the methylating enzyme itself. Administration of 17 alpha-estradiol, an inactive stereoisomer of E2 was ineffective, pointing to a stereospecific interaction. After differential centrifugation of pituitary membranes, the highest specific methyltransferase activity was found in light mitochondrial (L) and microsomal (P) fractions and the lowest in nuclei (N) and the heavy mitochondrial (M) fractions. After sucrose density gradient centrifugation, methylated phospholipids were preferentially recovered from fractions corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum and/or secretory granules. E2 treatment for 5 days did not modify the subcellular distribution of methyltransferase activity but stimulated it in all fractions; in contrast, it did not modify the activity of the other enzymes measured as fraction markers. Under the same experimental conditions, phospholipid methylation in membranes prepared from cortex, and anterior and mediobasal hypothalamic structures was not affected by the steroid, with the exception of a slight increment of [3H]methyl incorporation into mediobasal hypothalamic membrane phospholipids after 5 days of E2 treatment. These results indicate that E2-induced changes in pituitary responsiveness might be concomitant with selective effects of the steroid on specific membrane enzymatic activities involved in coupling mechanisms.',\n",
       " '87053573': 'From a single cell fusion, five stable hybridomas secreting antiovine placental lactogen (oPL) antibodies were obtained. Three of these secrete immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass, and the other two secrete IgM class antibodies. Ascites fluids were raised in mice for each clone and were used as the antibody component for the development of solid phase RIA. Three solid-phase RIAs were successfully established using individual IgG subclass monoclonal antibodies, but the IgM class antibodies were ineffective. In all three individual solid-phase RIAs, the binding of [125I]iodo-oPL to the immobilized antibody was inhibited by unlabeled oPL, but not by ovine pituitary PRL (oPRL), ovine GH (oGH), or ovine pituitary extract. Two of the IgG subclass antibodies were able to inhibit the binding of [125I] iodo-oPL to PRL receptors(s) and to GH receptor(s) in rabbit mammary gland and liver, respectively. One of these two IgG subclass antibodies was more effective at inhibiting the binding of oPL to PRL receptor(s) in rabbit mammary gland, whereas the other one is more effective in inhibiting the binding of oPL to GH receptor(s) in rabbit liver. These antibodies, however, could only weakly inhibit the binding of [125I]iodo-oPRL to rabbit mammary gland and were ineffective in inhibiting the binding of [125I]iodo-oGH to rabbit liver. The addition of monoclonal antibodies in both radioreceptor assay (RRA) for PRL (RRA-PRL) and for GH (RRA-GH) did not affect the parallelism of the displacement curve of oPL standard. Our results suggest that oPL might contain two distinct binding sequence(s): one responsible for the binding of oPL to PRL receptor(s) and the other responsible for the binding of oPL to GH receptor(s). These two binding sequences might overlap or be located adjacent to one another. The interaction of monoclonal antibodies with these binding sequences of oPL may block the binding of oPL with PRL and GH receptor(s). Alternatively, our studies suggest that the monoclonal antibodies do not bind to hormone receptor(s)-binding sequence(s) in oPL, but the interaction between oPL and monoclonal antibody might alter the conformational structure of the oPL which will consequently lead to a lower binding of oPL to PRL and GH receptor(s).',\n",
       " '87053574': 'We have previously demonstrated that T3 increases adenylate cyclase activity in rat thymocyte plasma membranes by a mechanism that is calcium dependent. In the present studies we have examined whether calmodulin participates in this response to T3. Initial experiments provided evidence that calmodulin is involved in regulating the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in this tissue. Thus, compared with findings in freshly prepared membranes, dialysis of thymocyte plasma membrane preparations for 20 h at 4 C decreased their calmodulin concentrations from an initial value of approximately 600 ng/100 micrograms protein by about 50% and decreased adenylate cyclase activity by approximately 80%. Although storage of the same preparations under comparable conditions resulted in no change in calmodulin content, it caused an approximate 30% decrease in adenylate cyclase activity. Addition of calmodulin had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity in fresh or stored membrane preparations, but produced a dose-dependent increase in enzyme activity in preparations that had been dialyzed. Further, when added to freshly isolated membranes, three calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine, calmidazolium, and calmodulin antibodies, all produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, and this was completely reversed in all cases by the addition of high concentrations of exogenous calmodulin. The stimulation of guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase activity that T3 induced in fresh membrane preparations was present in membranes that had been stored, but was absent in those that had been dialyzed. In addition, the response to T3 in fresh membranes was inhibited or abolished by all three calmodulin antagonists. Both in dialyzed membranes and in the presence of antagonists, the response to T3 was restored by the addition of exogenous calmodulin. We conclude that calmodulin influences the activity of the guanyl nucleotide-dependent adenylate cyclase in rat thymocytes and ultimately mediates the stimulation of enzyme activity that T3 produces. Such mediation very likely explains the calcium-dependent nature of the stimulatory effect of T3 on thymocyte adenylate cyclase activity.',\n",

To establish the value of ovariohysterectomy in female beagle dogs as a model for bone loss and to study static and dynamic parameters of bone associated with the negative bone balance occurring after cessation of ovarian function, we performed iliac crest bone biopsies before and 4 months after ovariohysterectomy in eight beagle dogs and in five sham-operated controls. Cessation of ovarian function was documented by an increase in serum levels of LH 4 weeks after ovariohysterectomy. There was no change in serum calcium, phosphorus, and creatinine during the 4 months of the study. Cancellous bone mass and trabecular mean wall thickness decreased significantly after ovariohysterectomy (P less than 0.01). In addition, the number of osteoblasts was increased and the bone formation rate per osteoblast, that is, the activity of bone-forming cells, was decreased (P less than 0.01). Parameters of bone resorption were not significantly altered in the animals with ovariohysterectomy. No changes in histomorphometric parameters of bone structure, formation or resorption were observed in the sham-operated controls. These data indicate that ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs may serve as a useful model for bone loss associated with cessation of ovarian function. Osteoblastic insufficiency appears to play a major role in the maintenance of bone loss occurring after ovariohysterectomy in beagle dogs.',\n",

Normal male littermates displayed a characteristic low frequency, high amplitude pattern of GH secretion with bursts of GH occurring every 2.5-3 h and separated by prolonged trough periods where GH values remained low or undetectable (less than 5 ng/ml) for 45-90 min. Normal female littermates showed a characteristic high frequency, low amplitude pattern of GH secretion with pulses of GH occurring every hour. Compared to normal male littermates, females had lower individual GH peak amplitudes and shortened GH-trough periods which contain higher GH levels. GH-secretory profiles displayed by testicular-feminized animals qualitatively and quantitatively resembled those of the normal female littermates. These data suggest that androgen receptors are necessary for the expression of masculine GH-secretory patterns.',\n",

In 21-day-old female rats, E was found to increase MBH DA levels and turnover and serum PRL concentrations in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Changes were observed by 1 day, and after 3 days of E treatment (1 microgram/day), MBH DA levels increased 2-fold (to 1300 pg/mg tissue), and DA turnover rates increased 5-fold (to 1170 pg/mg tissue . h). The AEs tamoxifen, monohydroxytamoxifen, CI628, and LY117018 (50 micrograms/day for 3 days) weakly stimulated uterine weight gain and significantly suppressed the uterotropic action of E. The AEs LY117018, monohydroxytamoxifen, CI628, and tamoxifen competed with E for binding to the MBH estrogen receptor and displayed relative binding affinities of 190%, 185%, 6.7%, and 1.4%, with E set at 100%; these affinities are similar to those found for uterine estrogen receptors. The AEs increased DA turnover rates only 2-fold, and they antagonized the E-induced 5-fold increase in DA turnover rates very successfully. In animals treated with bromocriptine, E and AE failed to increase the low serum PRL levels, yet they evoked significant (approximately 2-fold) increases in DA turnover rates and nearly 2-fold increases in MBH DA content. Hence, a part of the actions of E and AE on MBH DA appears to be exerted independently of changes in circulating PRL and may occur by direct action of these compounds on the estrogen receptor system present in the MBH. In addition, these studies reveal that AEs behave as partial estrogen agonists/antagonists in terms of their effects on MBH DA turnover.',\n",

For 3 h after iv bolus injection into euthyroid rats, 125I-labeled rTSH was determined by acid precipitation in serum and various organs, and unlabeled TSH was measured by RIA. The MCR of TSH from normal pituitary extracts (0.53 +/- 0.02 ml/min) was similar to that of unlabeled purified rTSH (0.52 +/- 0.03), while those from hypothyroid pituitary extracts (0.32 +/- 0.03) and hypothyroid sera (0.33 +/- 0.01) were decreased. The reduced MCR of TSH from hypothyroid pituitaries was due to a decreased distribution volume (8.4 +/- 0.6 ml) compared to that from normal pituitaries (11.4 +/- 0.7) and hypothyroid sera (10.9 +/- 0.8). The decreased MCR of circulating TSH from hypothyroid sera reflected an increase in its rt1/2 (12.6 +/- 0.5 min) vs. that from both normal (5.1 +/- 0.5) and hypothyroid (5.7 +/- 0.4) pituitaries. The rt1/2 of secreted TSH from incubated hypothyroid rat pituitaries (8.5 +/- 0.9) was intermediate between those of circulating and pituitary forms of hypothyroid rTSH. The clearances of intact bovine TSH (bTSH) and deglycosylated bTSH (dg-bTSH) were compared. The dg-bTSH MCR was found to be increased (0.71 +/- 0.02 ml/min) compared to that of bTSH (0.59 +/- 0.02), primarily due to a decreased rt1/2 for dg-bTSH (3.8 +/- 0.1 min) vs. bTSH (4.7 +/- 0.2). Uptake of purified [125I]rTSH was highest in the kidney at all times, varying from 43% of the injected dose at 5 min to 54% at 180 min. We conclude that in the euthyroid rat, 1) the metabolic clearance of TSH differs between pituitary and serum forms and appears to depend on specific molecular features that vary with the physiological state of the animal from which the TSH is derived; 2) since chemical deglycosylation increased the clearance of TSH, we speculate that the chemical basis for changes in TSH clearance may be related to alterations in its carbohydrate structure; and 3) for normal pituitary TSH, the kidney is the major organ of clearance.',\n",
       " '87053589': 'Diencephalic and mesencephalic neural sites regulating the biphasic effect of progesterone (P) were investigated using the hormone implantation technique in ovariectomized female golden hamsters primed with estrogen. Double barreled cannulae were implanted unilaterally and bilaterally in the medial preoptic area, anterior hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), central gray, or interpeduncular nucleus. Testing was conducted using a sequential paradigm; facilitation tests commenced after 44 h of estrogen priming. P-filled cannulae placed in the VMH region facilitated lordosis behavior in 42% and 60% of unilaterally and bilaterally implanted females, respectively. In the anterior hypothalamus, only P implants adjacent to the VMH area effectively promoted receptivity. Lordosis behavior was also observed in 20-36% of females with P implants in the medial preoptic area. P implants in central gray and interpeduncular nucleus regions had no significant facilitating effect on sexual behavior. Tests for inhibition occurred 24 h after facilitation testing and consisted of a pretest, followed by systemic P administration and a behavioral test 4-5 h later. During the pretest for inhibition, females that were receptive in the facilitation test attacked males more rapidly than previously nonreceptive animals and showed decrements in lordosis scores after systemic P delivery. This biphasic effect of P completely inhibited receptivity among several animals in the VMH group. Additional experiments, however, investigating the biphasic effect of P implants in the VMH suggested that the occurrence of copulation in the facilitation test may have been involved in mediating the subsequent increase in aggressive behavior and the suppression of sexual responsiveness in the inhibition test. Nevertheless, a final experiment showed that when P was implanted sequentially in the VMH, facilitation and, more importantly, a later reduction in lordosis behavioral scores occurred even when copulation was eliminated in the facilitation test. P implants in mesencephalic regions exerted no significant inhibitory effect on receptivity. These findings demonstrate that the biphasic action of P in the female hamster is regulated by nerve cells located in the diencephalon, especially in the VMH region.',\n",

At 37 C [125I]T3 uptake increased asymptotically; at 60 min the muscle contained 10% of the total [125I]T3 or 0.238 +/- 0.021% per mg wet tissue. At 0 C the [125I]T3 uptake was 1/5 of that at 37 C. The specific [125I]T3 uptake, determined by subtracting the uptake in the presence of 10 microM unlabeled T3 from the total [125I]T3 uptake, attained a plateau after 60 min. Washout experiments, done by first incubating the muscle for 60 min at 37 C or 0 C with [125I]T3 and then at 0 C for 3 h with unlabeled T3, showed that 21 +/- 2% or 58 +/- 4% of the radioactivity, respectively, was released, indicating an intracellular location of the hormone after incubation at 37 C. Addition of increasing concentrations of L-T3, D-T3 and L-T4 caused a progressive inhibition of the [125I]T3 uptake; the 50% inhibitory concentrations being 400 nM, 7 microM, and more than 15 microM, respectively. Preincubation of soleus muscles with metabolic inhibitors almost completely inhibited [125I]T3 specific uptake, with oligomycin and antimycin causing 98 +/- 4% and 81 +/- 3% reduction, respectively. Monodansylcadaverine and bacitracin, inhibitors of receptor-mediated endocytosis, reduced the specific [125I]T3 uptake in a dose-dependent manner up to 67 +/- 3% and 62 +/- 2%, respectively. These results indicate the presence of a saturable, stereospecific, and energy-dependent process responsible, at least in part, for T3 uptake in rat skeletal muscle. This specific T3 uptake may be a receptor-mediated endocytosis process.',\n",
       " '87053592': 'Angiotensin II (AII) binds to specific receptors in the lactotroph and stimulates PRL secretion from isolated rat pituitary cells. Since estrogens exert major regulatory actions on PRL secretion, the effects of estradiol (E2) on pituitary AII receptors and PRL responses were studied in vivo and in cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. In female rats, treatment with E2-containing Silastic capsules for 4 days caused a significant increase in PRA from 1.3 to 3 ng/ml X min and a 38% decrease in the binding of [125I]AII to anterior pituitary membrane-rich fractions (P less than 0.01). In vitro studies showed that treatment of cultured anterior pituitary cells with 1 nM E2 for 4 days caused a 57 +/- 6% decrease in AII receptor concentration with no change in binding affinity. Reduction of AII receptors by E2 in 4-day cultures was dose dependent and was demonstrable with E2 concentrations that occur in plasma during the estrous cycle (0.01-1 nM). The decrease in AII receptors in cells incubated with 1 nM E2 was near maximum after 24 h of culture, and results were similar when receptor concentrations were calculated per unit protein or per cell. Despite the substantial decrease in AII receptors, E2 treatment did not specifically decrease the responsiveness of the pituitary cells to AII stimulation. Thus, PRL responses to AII (10 nM) or TRH (100 nM) were unchanged after 1 day of E2 treatment and were increased after 4 days of treatment. These findings demonstrate that E2 has a direct inhibitory action on expression of pituitary AII receptors that is not accompanied by a decrease in AII-stimulated PRL secretion. In the rat pituitary, estrogen modulation of postreceptor events is the predominant determinant of lactotroph responsiveness during stimulation of PRL release by AII.',\n",
       " '87053593': 'A 52K glycoprotein is secreted by human breast cancer cells in culture after estrogen stimulation. Using monoclonal antibodies, we have quantitated and characterized the corresponding proteins of the cell compartment. Using pulse-chase experiments, we have shown that about 40% of the 52K protein is secreted, the majority being successively processed into a 48K and a 34K protein. This last protein is very stable. The processing is inhibited by lysosomotropic agents and leupeptin, suggesting that it occurs in acidic vesicles, such as lysosomes or endosomes. Estradiol increased the intracellular level of immunoreactive 52K related proteins by 4-fold. Its effect is, however, more obvious in the medium, since there is a constitutive level in the cell. The stimulatory effects of estradiol on [3H]mannose and [35S]methionine incorporation into these proteins were similar and the endoglycosydase H sensitivity of the proteins was not altered, suggesting that estradiol did not modulate the glycosylation step. Antiestrogens did not stimulate synthesis and glycosylation of the 52K related proteins. Estradiol also increased the stability of the 52K precursor as well as that of total proteins. We conclude that the secreted 52K protein is the precursor of two cellular proteins of 48K and 34K. Estradiol stimulates both the intracellular accumulation of these proteins and the secretion of the precursor.',\n",

In these previous studies, preincubation of intact cells or ghosts with testosterone (5 X 10(-11) M) converted female-source reticulocyte membranes to male-type responsiveness to thyroid hormone (inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity). Preincubation of reticulocyte membranes with 17 beta-estradiol (5 X 10(-11) M) converted male-source membranes to female-type responsiveness (stimulation by L-T4 of membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity). Using this sex steroid-sensitive thyroid hormone-dependent membrane enzyme system, we investigated the structure-activity relationships of analogs of sex steroids and unrelated steroids. 5 beta-Androstanes were active compared to testosterone in assays using female-source membranes, while 5 alpha-androstanes were less active. Within the 5 beta-androstanes, activity was dependent on at least one hydroxyl group at the C3- or C17-position. Nongonadal steroids tested were less active, establishing specificity of the sex steroid effect in assays using female-source membranes. Assayed in male-source membranes, estrone and 3-hydroxy-1,3,5-(10)7-estratraen-17-one (equilin) were active compared for estrogen effect with 17 beta-estradiol, while estriol was less active. The activities of hydrocortisone and aldosterone were 76% and 71%, respectively, in this system. These structure-activity relationships are distinct from those described for gonadal steroid-cytoplasmic binding proteins or nuclear interactions, and represent a novel sex steroid-thyroid hormone effect on activity of a membrane enzyme.',\n",

The effects of cAMP-related drugs on POMC messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were assessed in primary cultures of intermediate (IL) and anterior rat pituitary cells maintained in serum-free medium. 8-Bromo-cAMP (1 mM), but not 8-bromo-cGMP (1 mM), induced a 2-fold increase in IL and anterior lobe cell after 2 days of treatment. A similar increase was obtained with the adenylate cyclase-activating drugs forskolin (1 microM) and cholera toxin (100 ng/ml) or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor RO 20-1724 (100 microM). At 48 h, all these treatments had increased beta-endorphin accumulation in the medium and transiently decreased the cellular beta-endorphin content in IL cells, suggesting a parallel effect of cAMP-related drugs on secretion and biosynthesis. Incubating the cells with the Ca++ channel antagonists D600 (50 microM), verapamil (50 microM), and the dihydropyridine nifedipine (0.1 microM) decreased basal POMC mRNA levels, whereas the dihydropyridine BAYK 8644 (0.1 microM), which activates the Ca++ channel, increased POMC mRNA levels after 2 days. In addition, nifedipine decreased the stimulatory effect of forskolin, whereas BAYK 8644 further stimulated the forskolin-increased POMC mRNA levels in IL cells. We conclude that both Ca++ and cAMP may regulate the gene expression of POMC.',\n",
       " '87053601': 'The release of PRL from the pituitary of a teleost fish, the tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), has been previously shown to be dependent on calcium. However, the source(s) and specific action(s) of calcium in the secretory process have not been identified. Also undefined are the mechanisms by which regulators of PRL cell function may alter calcium distribution. In the present investigation, the elevation of medium K+ concentration during static incubations to a depolarizing concentration (56 mM) produced no change in cumulative PRL release over control levels during the 18-20 h of incubation. During perifusion incubation, exposure to high K+ concentrations briefly stimulated (less than or equal to 10 min) and then depressed PRL release. In contrast, reduced medium osmotic pressure elicited a rapid elevation in PRL release that was sustained for 2 h or more. D600, a calcium entry blocker, at 10(-5) M diminished the K+-induced pulses of PRL release. The same concentration, however, did not alter the release of PRL evoked by reduced osmotic pressure. In contrast, CoCl2, which blocks a range of calcium-mediated processes in addition to calcium influx, suppressed PRL release during perifusion and static incubations in hyposmotic medium. These findings suggest that while PRL secretion from the tilapia pituitary is calcium dependent, calcium entry through voltage-regulated plasmalemma channels may not be a prerequisite to the actions of reduced osmotic pressure.',\n",

Recent studies show that daylength during the prenatal period is perceived by the fetus and that this perception can profoundly influence postnatal reproductive and somatic development. Using the photoperiodic Djungarian hamster, we assessed the role of the maternal pineal gland and its hormone, melatonin, in this prenatal perception of daylength. Maternal pinealectomy eliminated the influence of prenatal photoperiod on testicular and body weights of male pups, suggesting that a product from the maternal pineal gland communicates daylength to the fetus. Infusion of the pineal hormone melatonin into pinealectomized dams for various durations during gestation mimicked the effect of varying the prenatal photoperiod on both testicular and body weights. These results indicate that pineal melatonin is involved in this novel form of communication from mother to fetus.',\n",

In the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3, there was a rapid and steady decline in PTH gene transcription rate which fell to a minimum of 10-15% of control at 24 h.

The assay exhibited exquisite sensitivity (156 fg rat PRL per assay slide) and could be used to evaluate the biopotency of PRL released from individual cells. By combining this \"plaque bioassay\" with a standard plaque assay for measuring the secretion of immunoreactive PRL, it was possible to compare the bio- and immuno-potencies of hormone released from the same pituitary cells. The results of three separate studies revealed major differences among PRL secretors in these potency estimates.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis and autoradiography of purified receptor, radioiodinated receptor, and affinity-labeled receptor all indicated a molecular mass of approximately 250K. Scatchard analysis of IGF-II binding to purified receptor, solubilized microsomal membranes, or plasma membranes showed a single class of binding site with an affinity constant of 6 X 10(10) liter/mol in all cases. Potent antibodies to the purified receptor were raised in rabbits, capable of inhibiting 50% of IGF-II binding at dilutions of 1:170,000 and also of fully precipitating IGF-II-prelabeled receptor at 1:50,000. Both types of antibodies reacted with IGF-II receptors in rat adipose tissue, brain, heart, kidney, lung, and spleen. However, little cross-reactivity was seen with other species. Comparison of the ability of receptor antibodies to inhibit IGF-II binding to microsomal and plasma membranes indicated a specific immunological difference between the IGF-II receptors in the two membrane preparations.',\n",

Mouse thyrotropic tumor tissue, or pituitaries from euthyroid or hypothyroid mice, were incubated with D-[2-3H]Man, homogenized, and incubated in the presence or absence of pH 3 buffer to dissociate heterodimers. Highly enriched TSH beta-subunits, or TSH heterodimers, were obtained using anti-TSH beta serum and free alpha-subunits were subsequently obtained using anti-LH alpha-serum. High Man units released by endoglycosidase H were analyzed by paper chromatography. At 1 and 3 h oligosaccharides with 8 or 9 Man residues predominated in all subunits. In all three tissue types, units with 9 Man tended to accumulate in TSH beta-subunits, whereas Man-trimming from Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc proceeded more rapidly in TSH alpha-subunits, and in free alpha-subunits. The rate of TSH beta-subunit processing was also a function of tissue type; the rate in euthyroid pituitary tissue equaled that in tumor tissue and was greater than that in hypothyroid pituitary tissue, suggesting that processing may be physiologically regulated. Hypothyroid calf serum slowed TSH alpha-subunit processing in euthyroid pituitaries. Thus, the previously reported slower processing of Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc in heterodimers as compared to free alpha-subunits is in large part due to accumulation of Man9GlcNAc in TSH beta-subunits.',\n",
       " '87053608': 'It is well known that LH and human CG (hCG) induce an increase in total ovarian blood flow. The effect of LH/hCG on luteal blood flow, however, is unknown. This work studies the effect of hCG on both luteal and ovarian blood flows at different stages of pseudopregnancy in adult female rats. Pseudopregnancy was induced by mating with sterile male rats. The length of pseudopregnancy was 13 +/- 1 days and, during this time, blood flow was measured by the injection of radioactive microspheres during anesthesia. At autopsy, the corpora lutea were identified and extirpated under a stereomicroscope. These, and the remaining ovary, were then counted for radioactivity and the blood flow was calculated. Progesterone levels were determined in plasma and ovarian tissues. Furthermore, the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase was tested in ovarian tissues at day 6 of pseudopregnancy. An intraarterial injection of hCG (50 IU) or vehicle (saline) was given 20 min before the blood flow determinations in anesthetized rats. The luteal blood flow was not changed by hCG on days 2, 6, and 11 of pseudopregnancy, whereas in the remaining ovary the blood flow increased more than 2-fold, thereby resulting in redistribution of the blood flow. Ten micrograms of NIH-LH-B9, tested at day 6 of pseudopregnancy, mimicked the effect of hCG. At day 6 of pseudopregnancy, hCG (50 IU) was given ip to conscious rats 200 min and 24 h before blood flow determinations. At 200 min after hCG there was a more pronounced redistribution of ovarian blood flow with a 45% reduction in luteal blood flow and a 4-fold increase in flow through the remaining ovary. LH as well as hCG doubled the progesterone content of the remaining ovary. In the corpora lutea an increased progesterone content was seen after 200 min of hCG exposure. At 24 h after hCG injection, all parameters had returned to control levels except that adenylate cyclase was nonresponsive. The increase in the total ovarian blood flow coincides with the increased steroidogenesis and these effects are likely due to release of metabolites and/or vasoactive substances. Despite this increase, the blood flow of the corpus luteum was not increased rendering vascular mechanisms unlikely as a part of the acute LH/hCG effects on corpus luteum of pseudopregnancy.',\n",

Both IGF-I and IGF-II are potent stimulators of amino acid uptake, cell proliferation, and differentiation; they also suppress protein degradation in these cells. In all measurements, the relative potencies are IGF-I greater than IGF-II greater than insulin. Two recombinant DNA-produced analogs of IGF-I, (Thr59)IGF-I and (N-Met)IGF-I, were as active as native IGF-I in all four assays. However, when 125I-labeled hormones were used for studies of binding to IGF receptors, there was a striking difference between the native and recombinant IGF-I molecules. Both were bound significantly by the type I receptor (a 350K molecule that is dissociated upon sulfhydryl reduction), but the recombinant analogs exhibited little cross-reactivity with the type II receptor (a 220K molecule that is not dissociated by reduction). Thus, the equal activity of native IGF-I and its recombinant DNA-produced analogs coupled with the higher potency of IGF-I (compared to IGF-II) suggest that the type II receptor plays little or no role in the four actions of the somatomedins studied in L6 myoblasts.',\n",

Constitutive steroidogenesis was investigated by comparing constitutively active R2C Leydig tumor cells to trophic hormone-responsive MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. Unlike the MA-10 cells, R2C cells appeared to synthesize steroid hormones independently of the cAMP-protein kinase pathway. Although the adenylate cyclase of R2C cells could be stimulated in the expected manner by cholera toxin, cAMP concentrations in these cells were low, and R2C cell steroidogenesis could be dissociated from other cAMP-dependent processes. Two cAMP-dependent processes in steroidogenic cells, protein kinase activation and lactate formation, showed low basal activities in R2C cells and could be stimulated by (Bu)2cAMP with a dose dependence similar to that detected in MA-10 cells. Steroid hormone biosynthesis parallelled these other cAMP-dependent processes in MA-10 cells, but not in R2C cells. Cycloheximide, however, caused similar dose-dependent inhibition of steroidogenesis in both the R2C and MA-10 cells. Using a cell component bioassay, it was shown that R2C cells constitutively synthesize an extramitochondrial cycloheximide-sensitive factor that is functionally identical to the factor produced in response to hCG in MA-10 cells. This factor enhanced mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis. Thus, constitutive steroidogenesis in R2C cells could be explained by the cAMP-independent but cycloheximide-sensitive constitutive production of an extramitochondrial factor that activated mitochondrial pregnenolone biosynthesis.',\n",
       " '87053614': 'Although an action of corticosteroids to inhibit glucose transport is well known, the mechanism by which this is brought about has been unclear. Some evidence has suggested an action on insulin receptors, but a postbinding or postreceptor effect has also been reported. As hydrogen peroxide acts at a postbinding site to stimulate glucose transport, studies were carried out in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to determine whether corticosteroids would inhibit hydrogen peroxide-induced glucose transport. In this cell type, both insulin and hydrogen peroxide produced a marked increase in glucose transport after a 30-min incubation. The increase produced by hydrogen peroxide, as well as insulin, was inhibited by previous incubation of the cells with dexamethasone. These findings give further support to the conclusion that dexamethasone has effects on glucose transport at a postbinding site. As changes in membrane lipids influence the movement and/or activity of glucose transporters, and dexamethasone alters membrane lipids, dexamethasone-induced changes in the lipids of the plasma membrane may be important in the mediation of the steroid effect upon glucose transport.',\n",

The mol wt of this peptide is about 25,000, as determined by gel filtration chromatography and immunoblot analysis of samples resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing indicated that the isoelectric point of this peptide was near neutrality. However, a smaller peptide of mol wt 8,000 that cross-reacted with antibodies to Sm-C/IGF-I, was released after gel filtration in acetic acid. Similarly, reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column under acidic conditions released a Sm-C/IGF-I immunoreactive peptide of 8,000 mol wt. This smaller species apparently resulted from the dissociation of this peptide from a binding protein. Unlike the larger neutral form, the isoelectric point of the smaller peptide was 9.8. This pI is similar to the GH-dependent Sm-C/IGF-I peptide isolated from rat serum. The small peptide, unlike the larger form, reacted in a parallel manner to human Sm-C/IGF-I in the Sm-C/IGF-I RIA and radioreceptor assays. In addition, the 8,000 mol wt peptide behaved as a progression factor in the BALB/c-3T3 assay and competed with [125I]Sm-C/IGF-I for binding to the type I Sm-C/IGF-I receptor from cultured rat Sertoli cells.

It is known from previous studies that the content of cholesterol in the inner zone is considerably lower than that in the outer zone, although basal low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity is similar in the two zones. To further explore cholesterol metabolism in the guinea pig adrenal cortex, the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, has been examined for which this paper forms the initial report. It was found that the basal specific activity of HMG-CoA reductase was similar in the outer and inner adrenocortical zones (approximately 230 pmol mevalonate formed/min X mg microsomal protein). The administration of ACTH caused 4- and 5-fold increases in HMG-CoA reductase activity in the outer and inner zones, respectively. In fact, the increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity with ACTH treatment was always greater for the inner zone than for the outer zone. This is in contrast to LDL receptor activity, which does not increase in the inner zone as it does in the outer zone with ACTH treatment. When dexamethasone was administered, HMG-CoA reductase activity decreased in the outer zone by about 50%, while there was no change in reductase activity in the inner zone. The latter finding is similar to what happens with LDL receptor activity during dexamethasone administration. Why suppression of endogenous ACTH had no effect on HMG-CoA reductase activity in the inner zone while exogenous ACTH administration caused a marked increase in enzyme activity is not clear, but may be related to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms. Based on the use of sodium fluoride in solutions to block HMG-CoA reductase phosphatase, evidence is presented which indicates that a pharmacological dose of ACTH alters the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation status of HMG-CoA reductase in the inner adrenocortical zone, but not in the outer cortical zone.',\n",

To determine whether the rat system serves as a general model for prodynorphin processing in the mammalian posterior pituitary, we examined the steady state levels of prodynorphin-derived opioid peptides in the posterior pituitary systems of representatives of three diverse orders of mammals: guinea pig (order Rodentia), pig (order Artiodactyla), and rhesus monkey (order Primates). In each species studied there was evidence for species-specific deviations from the rat model. The most pronounced differences were observed with respect to the conversion of dynorphin A-(1-17) to dynorphin A-(1-8). In rodents, rats, and guinea pigs, under steady state conditions, the molar ratios of these forms are approximately 1:2 and 2.5:1, respectively. However, in the pig and rhesus monkey, the molar ratios of these forms are 10:1 and 14:1, respectively. Thus, under steady state conditions, the conversion of dynorphin A-(1-17) to dynorphin A-(1-8) appears to be a minor event in porcine and rhesus monkey posterior pituitary. Species-specific variations were also observed with respect to the steady state levels of alpha-neo-endorphin and dynorphin B-(1-13).

The percentage of plaque-forming cells in both sexes gradually increased with age from about 5% of the total anterior pituitary cell population at 5 days of age to the adult levels of about 54% in the females at proestrus and about 37% in the males. Sexual differences in the percentage of plaque-forming cells were consistently seen at 40 days of age and thereafter. The mean size of plaques in both sexes also increased with age from about 1,100 microns 2 at 5 days of age to a peak level of about 15,600 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 6,700 microns 2 in the males at 60 days of age; then fell to the adult levels of about 5,500 microns 2 in the females at proestrus and about 3,200 microns 2 in males. Sexual differences first appeared at 40 days of age and were estrogen-dependent. The results from ICC closely matched those from the plaque assay, except at 5 days of age and in the adult males. At 5 days, the fraction of cells staining for PRL was twice that of cells forming plaques. In adult male rats there were about 47% immunostained PRL cells but only about 39% plaque-forming cells. This difference, however, disappeared after estrogen treatment. These results demonstrate that sexual differences in the lactotrope population develop around puberty in rats and appear to be estrogen dependent.',\n",

Uterine flushings (UTF) and endometrium (ENDOM) from one uterine horn of nonpregnant and pregnant gilts (n = 9) were collected on days 10, 12, and 14 (n = 3). Protein, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.05), Na+, and K+ (P less than 0.01) increased linearly in UTF of pregnant gilts. Ca2+ changed biphasically, with higher concentrations (P less than 0.01) in pregnant gilts on day 12. Endometrial cAMP and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased between days 12 and 14 of pregnancy. The UTF norepinephrine (NE) concentrations increased (P less than 0.01) in cyclic gilts between days 12 and 14, while endometrial NE increased between days 10 and 12 and then decreased on day 14. The UTF of pregnant gilts had higher (P less than 0.05) concentrations of dopamine (DA), which peaked on day 12 and then decreased (P less than 0.01) by day 14. DA in UTF of nonpregnant gilts decreased between days 10 and 12 and remained low on day 14. A catecholamine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, in ENDOM (P less than 0.05) and UTF (P less than 0.01) decreased linearly between days 10 and 14. The turnover rate of endometrial catecholamines was 2.4-fold higher (P less than 0.05) during early pregnancy compared with that in cyclic gilts. Effects of acute administration of exogenous E (0.5 mg) were also studied. The UTF and ENDOM were from day 11 nonpregnant gilts 0, 30, 60, and 360 min (n = 3) post-E or post-saline-ethanol (C) injection (n = 9). Potassium, plasma inhibitor (P less than 0.01), and cGMP (P less than 0.05) increased rapidly (30 min) after E injection. The K+ level changed biphasically, with increased concentrations again at 360 min. Plasmin inhibitor returned to levels similar to controls by 60 min, whereas cGMP remained elevated until 360 min postinjection when E, Ca2+, K+ (P less than 0.01), and Na+ (P less than 0.03) were increased. ENDOM NE (P less than 0.05) and UTF DA (P less than 0.05) were lower in E-treated gilts. Additionally, the turnover rate was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) for NE and DA in the UTF of E-treated gilts. An increase in Ca2+ in UTF preceded increases in protein secretions (except plasmin inhibitor) and may play a role in E-stimulated endometrial epithelial secretory vesicle exocytosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)',\n",
       " '87053630': '17 beta-Estradiol increases the growth rate of GH4C1 cells with a half-maximally effective concentration (EC50) that is about 10-fold less than the EC50 for the stimulation of PRL production. We have examined the effects of five other estrogens: estriol, estrone, 17 alpha-estradiol, and the metabolism-resistant analogs ethynyl estradiol and moxestrol. All were full agonists for both effects, and all were more potent for the stimulation of cell growth than for stimulation of PRL production. The order of analog potency for both biological effects was the same as the order of potency for inhibiting saturable [3H]estradiol binding to intact cells. Therefore, both biological effects appear to be mediated through the same receptor, and metabolism of 17 beta-estradiol is unlikely to account for the difference in the concentrations required to elicit the two effects. We selected two estrogen-responsive clones from a cDNA library made from GH4C1 cells. The clones were chosen because they were induced at the estrogen concentrations that stimulate growth. Estradiol caused maximal stimulation of the mRNAs corresponding to the two recombinant clones at 10(-10) M, a concentration over 10-fold lower than that required for maximal stimulation of PRL mRNA. These data indicate that a difference in sensitivity to estrogen occurs at the level of mRNA accumulation as well as at the level of the biological responses.',\n",

Sc from 14- and 18-day-old rats were maintained for 13 days in one of the following media: Modified Eagle's Medium-Ham's F-12 (DFM), DFM plus insulin, epidermal growth factor, progesterone, hydrocortisone, and vitamins A and E (6F), 6F plus testosterone (7F), 7F plus FSH (8F), 6F plus 2% fetal bovine serum (6F2S), 6F plus 5% fetal bovine serum (6F5S). The monolayer permeability to [3H]inulin decreased rapidly during the initial 3-5 days of culture for the Sc isolated from 18- and 14-day old animals, then remained stable in all media except DFM. Morphological examination revealed the presence of tight junctions between neighbouring Sc in both age groups, indicating their de novo formation. Secretion of Trf was lowest in DFM and steadily declined. In all other media, Trf secretion peaked on day 5 and remained relatively constant after day 7. Medium 7F only slightly and inconsistently increased the secretion, whereas 8F was always highly stimulatory compared to 6F. Supplementation of 6F with serum resulted in the greatest Trf secretion. In the case of ABP, three different secretion patterns were noted depending on the medium composition; secretion was greatest in the presence of 5% fetal bovine serum. The medium supplements also differentially affected the polarity of Trf and ABP secretion. The ratio of Trf secreted to the outer and inner compartments (OC/IC) was approximately 2.0 in DFM and was not influenced by supplements in 6F, 7F, and 8F. However, in serum-containing media, the OC/IC ratio gradually increased with time to about 5.0 on day 13. The average OC/IC ratio of ABP was 1.7 in DFM and, in contrast to Trf, declined to 0.7 in other serum-free media. Serum supplementation reversed and increased the ABP ratio to about 6.0 on day 13. These data indicate that Sc grown on permeable supports form confluent monolayers that limit the diffusion of macromolecules, most likely due to the formation of tight junctions. The monolayer permeability as well as the total and polarized secretion of Trf and ABP are differentially regulated by hormones and serum factors.\",\n",

Controls received either 0.01 M PBS (1 ml, im; n = 2) or 0.01 M gel-PBS (gel; 1 ml, os; n = 2) in cervical os. One relaxin-treated (im) heifer calved at 4 h and 36 min after treatment; thus, data from this heifer were not included in subsequent analysis. Relaxin-treated heifers showed an acute elevation in relaxin, a precipitous decrease in progesterone, and a significant (P less than 0.05) elevation of E1 and 17 beta-E2. Plasma relaxin levels were 4.95, 1.5, and 0.24 ng/ml at 0.5 h in RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and control animals, respectively. Peripheral plasma relaxin peaked between 23-31 ng/ml 1-2.5 h before returning to less than 0.5 ng/ml 5-12 h after treatment. Relaxin administration accounted for 70%, 73%, and 58% of the progesterone, E1, and 17 beta-E2 variability between treatments, respectively. An abrupt decrease (P less than 0.01) in progesterone preceded the rises (P less than 0.05) in E1 and 17 beta-E2 at 1.5, 2-2.5, and 2-3.5 h, respectively. Maximum progesterone deviations from the pretreatment mean concentration were -5.43, -3.05, and -0.92 ng/ml for RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and controls. Progesterone rebounded from 36% to 61% and 62% to 79% of respective pretreatment means for RLX-IM and RLX-OS. Peak elevation of E1 was 407.3, 306.5, and 71.5 pg/ml and that of 17 beta-E2 was 82.2, 35.8, and 7.8 ng/ml for RLX-IM, RLX-OS, and controls, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that a pharmacological dosage of relaxin induces an acute depression of progesterone secretion beginning within 90 min in beef heifers during late pregnancy. We suggest that these early and marked luteolytic effects of relaxin on progesterone secretion in cattle could be by direct or indirect actions via mechanisms that are yet unknown.',\n",
       " '87053638': 'In order to investigate the localization of nuclear T3 receptors in adult rat brain, we have developed a technique for separating neuronal and glial nuclei, and compared nuclear T3 binding in both fractions. Glial and neuronal nuclear populations were prepared by homogenization of the whole brain except the cerebellum, followed by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation in 2.4 and 2.2 M sucrose. For purposes of comparison, liver nuclei were prepared by centrifugation in 2.4 M sucrose. Microscopic examination of the nuclei confirmed the purity of the two nuclear fractions to be above 90% with minimal extranuclear contamination. T3 binding studies were performed on the washed nuclear fractions using saturation analysis techniques. Maximum binding (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) were obtained by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. After 30 min incubation at 37 C, Bmax in neuronal nuclei was 1203 +/- 118 fmol/mg DNA (mean +/- SE) (n = 6), in comparison with 196 +/- 14 fmol/mg DNA in glial nuclei (n = 7). The corrected value for Bmax in glial nuclei, assuming 8% neuronal nuclear contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was contamination, was 100 fmol/mg DNA. Bmax in liver nuclei was 299 +/- 38 fmol/mg DNA (n = 6). The Kd values were 0.38 +/- 0.04 nM, 0.34 +/- 0.05 nM, and 0.33 +/- 0.04 nM in neuronal, glial, and liver nuclei, respectively. The specificity of T3 binding to the nuclear receptor in both neuronal and glial nuclei was studied in competition studies, and revealed closely similar relative binding affinities (T3 greater than T4 greater than rT3) in both. We conclude that the higher T3 binding capacity of neuronal nuclei may be related to their higher protein synthetic ability, suggesting that T3 may be of importance in a rapid structural turnover in these cells. The effect of T3 on myelination in glial cells may be mediated through the nucleus.',\n",
       " '87053640': 'Anestrous hamsters exhibit daily afternoon gonadotropin and progesterone surges, but little estrogen secretion. In the first experiment, short day anestrous females were transferred to long days to detect hormonal changes associated with recovery of cyclicity. Morning and afternoon blood samples were taken at increasing durations in long days. Females autopsied at their first vaginal estrus after transfer to long days differed from long day estrous controls only in their lower uterine weights. Some females at all durations exhibited signs of recovery, though they had not yet shown estrus. They did not display afternoon gonadotropin surges and had low circulating progesterone but high estradiol levels, stimulated uteri, and enhanced follicular development. Results of the second and third experiments provided evidence that the daily gonadotropin surges are not the cause per se of anestrus, and that changes in estrogen secretion are essential for the transition to and from anestrus. Phenobarbital blockade of the daily surges in anestrous females did not result in increased follicular growth and estrogen secretion. Furthermore, daily afternoon injections of gonadotropins it appears that the daily surges in anestrous hamsters simply reflect low estradiol levels. It is still not known what signal promotes rapid follicular maturation during the recovery from anestrus. Once initiated, however, this recovery appears to occur within a few days, with a rapid cascade of events. First, follicular development and estrogen secretion resume, and the daily LH surges cease. Then, progesterone levels decline, and an ovulatory surge of gonadotropins is triggered.',\n",
       " '87053642': 'TSH is a glycoprotein hormone whose carbohydrate content varies among different species. Although recent studies suggest that variants of TSH deficient in carbohydrate occur naturally, the significance of the carbohydrate moiety of TSH in respect to its thyrotropic function is unclear. The present studies were undertaken, therefore, to examine this question. A highly purified preparation of bovine TSH (bTSH) was deglycosylated by treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Amino acid and carbohydrate analyses of the original and deglycosylated preparations indicated that approximately 85% of the carbohydrate originally present had been removed and that the protein moiety was unaltered. As judged from TSH radioreceptor assays, bTSH and deglycosylated bTSH (dg-bTSH) bound to human thyroid membranes with equal affinity, since both caused a half-maximal inhibition of [125I]bTSH binding at approximately equal concentrations. Nonetheless, dg-bTSH at optimal concentration displayed only about one third the activity of intact TSH in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity in human thyroid membranes. dg-bTSH also antagonized the adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity of intact bTSH in this system, but only weakly, since abolition of the bTSH effect required an approximately 40-fold higher concentration of dg-bTSH. In cultures of FRTL5 cells, a cloned line of follicular cells derived from normal rat thyroid, both intact and dg-bTSH enhanced cell growth, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and stimulated cAMP release in the medium, but the response elicited by dg-bTSH was much less than that caused by equal concentrations of the intact hormone. In accord with the findings in the in vitro assays, dg-bTSH evoked a much smaller response than bTSH did in the in vivo mouse assay. It is concluded that although not required for receptor recognition, the carbohydrate moiety of bTSH is essential for the full expression of its biological activity.',\n",
       " '87053645': 'PRL and GH are stored in bovine pituitary secretory granules in part as intermolecular disulfide-linked multimers (as many as 50 monomers/oligomer). In vitro incubation of granules with reduced glutathione (GSH) results in the production of monomeric hormones and increased hormone release. We tested the hypothesis that increases in intragranular osmolality due to conversion of oligomers to lower mol wt forms are key to granule rupture. Hormone release was measured after granule incubations in medium made hyperosmotic by the addition of raffinose or sucrose. PRL release at pH 7.8 with 0.7 M raffinose was reduced to 43.5% of the control value, whereas GH release ranged from 70-100% of the control value. Augmented release stimulated by 2 mM GSH was also diminished by raffinose, to 17.9% (PRL) and 75.6% (GH) of control values. The IC50 for raffinose inhibition of PRL release was 0.62 M; this shifted to 0.38 M in the presence of 2 mM GSH. Raffinose also blunted the granule response to GSH at all other GSH concentrations tested and decreased stimulated release at pH 9 as well as at 7.8. Interference with the ability to maintain an osmotic gradient, a maneuver accomplished by partial disruption of granule membranes with 0.5% deoxycholate treatment, reduced or abolished the raffinose inhibition. Molecular sizing of granule fractions on Superose-6 (Pharmacia) indicated that PRL monomers remaining in the pelletable granule fraction increased with raffinose about 2-fold under both basal and GSH-stimulated conditions. These data support the concept that thiol:disulfide equilibria may be important in PRL and GH storage and secretion by their influence on intragranular osmolality. In exocytosis in vivo, osmotically mediated granule rupture may be triggered by thiols during granule:plasma membrane fusion.',\n",
       " '87053648': 'The metabolism of vitamin D3 was studied in chicks after experimental fractures were performed on their tibiae. The chicks were fed for 3 weeks a vitamin D-deficient diet but were supplemented with radioactive labeled vitamin D3. The chicks were then divided into two groups. In the first group the right tibia was fractured, whereas the second group served as nonfractured control group. During the following days of fracture healing, the metabolites of [3H]vitamin D3 were measured in callus, epiphysis, diaphysis, plasma, duodenum, and kidney. Histological examination of calluses and bones, measurements of intestinal absorption of calcium, and renal production of dihydroxylated metabolites of vitamin D3 were performed as well. The levels of the dihydroxylated metabolites were increased in the calluses and the levels of [3H]24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were found to coincide with the formation of cartilaginous tissue and with the renal production of this steroid. In the duodenum of the fractured chicks, the levels of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 dropped significantly during the first week after fracture, coinciding with reduction in the intestinal absorption of calcium. In the plasma during those 3 weeks of healing process the levels of [3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were far below normal. These findings indicate that during the process of fracture repair, changes in the metabolism and expression of vitamin D are taking place in order to meet the new requirements of the body under stress condition of skeletal fracture.',\n",

BT20 cells did not express the isoenzyme phenotypic to breast, but ectopically expressed the isoenzyme phenotypic to term placenta and other embryonic tissue. Treatment of BT20 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 results in a 30% decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity of the embryonic isoenzyme. There was a 2-fold increase in activity after treatment with HC, and enzyme activity was similar to control values after treatment with both hormones. For both cell lines, changes in alkaline phosphatase activity correlated with changes in nanograms of isoenzyme per mg cellular protein, as measured by RIA. Increases in enzyme activity were inhibited when the cells were incubated simultaneously with the steroids and cycloheximide. Studies with receptors in each cell line showed that both cell lines bound 1,25-(OH)2D3 and that a 1,25-(OH)2D3-binding protein with the same mol wt as the D3 receptor was present in both. The BT20 cells also express a larger mol wt protein which binds 1,25-(OH)2D3 but is not as specific for the 1,25-(OH)2D3 isomer. HC receptors were similar in quantity and binding affinity in both cell lines.',\n",

Radioautographs of two-dimensional gels of the in vitro translational products of RNA were quantitated by computer-assisted videodensitometry and analyzed by multivariate statistics. Of the 250 spots observed, each presumably representing the translational product of a separate messenger RNA, 21 were responsive to changes in hormonal state. Eighteen increased and two decreased at some stage in the transition from the hypothyroid to the hyperthyroid state. One spot changed in a biphasic manner. Eight products responded to the lipogenic diet, six increasing and two decreasing. Six of these eight spots responded in a similar fashion to thyroid hormone administration. As previously shown for liver, there appears to be a substantial overlap between the genomic response to carbohydrate and thyroid hormone administration. Whereas the carbohydrate-generated changes are largely included in the thyroid-hormone induced alterations, the majority of thyroid hormone responsive changes are not duplicated by the diet. Multivariate analysis showed a clear separation of each state from the others and revealed that it was necessary to monitor only nine spots to achieve an effective separation of the states analyzed.',\n",

Maximal binding capacity was measured by in vivo saturation analysis. Nuclear receptor occupancy at endogenous levels of T3 and T4 in euthyroid rats was estimated from the equilibrium nuclear to serum ratio of tracer T3, and the locally generated nuclear T3 to serum T4 ratio after injecting tracer T3 and T4. These ratios were multiplied, respectively, by the endogenous concentrations of T3 and T4 as measured by RIA. The maximal binding capacity was 0.65 ng T3/mg DNA, and saturation was 71%. Fifty-five percent of the nuclear T3 was generated locally, and 45% was derived from circulating T3. BAT is, hence, comparable to the liver in number of receptors (approximately 5000/cell) and to the pituitary with regard to saturation and relative contributions of locally generated T3 and plasma T3 to nuclear T3. These results suggest that BAT may be an important target for thyroid hormones and, along with other data, that alterations in the activity of the type II 5'-deiodinase of this tissue may influence the saturation of nuclear T3 receptors.\",\n",

After drinking 2% NaCl for 2 weeks, a 2-fold increase in the OT mRNA content was found by Northern blot analysis of microdissected supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The same samples showed a similar change in vasopressin (VP) mRNA levels. This treatment resulted in a 70% depletion of both OT and VP from the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland and a marked increase in OT and VP plasma levels. Analysis of the OT mRNA concentration by quantitative in situ hybridization showed that the SON, PVN, and anterior commissural nucleus responded similarly, with a 1.5-fold increase in OT mRNA after 7 days of osmotic stimulation. These results demonstrate that OT gene expression in the magnocellular neurons of the SON, PVN, and anterior commissural nucleus is sensitive to this osmotic stimulus, as is the VP gene of magnocellular neurons in the SON and PVN. The responsiveness of OT-producing neurons may point to a role for OT in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance.',\n",
       " '87053662': 'One of the earliest responses of the thyroid cells to TSH is macropinocytosis with formation of intracellular colloid droplets. We demonstrate here that increasing stimulation with TSH not only elicits a highly individual macropinocytotic response among different follicular cells but that the fraction of TSH-responsive cells is also a function of the TSH dose. After pretreatment with T4, mice and rats were injected ip with bovine TSH and killed 2 h later. The macropinocytotic response to TSH was evaluated on periodic acid-Schiff-stained 3-microns sections of the thyroids in terms of droplet number per 25 follicles and, in addition, by assessing recruitment, i.e. percentage of droplet-containing cells. Both variables increased with increasing TSH stimulation until they reached a plateau at about 9 mU TSH in mice and at about 300 mU TSH in rats: the percentage of droplet-containing cells gradually increased in mice from 2% (no TSH) to 67% (9 mU TSH) and in rats from 11% (no TSH) to 54% (300 mU TSH). Overall pinocytotic response as well as thyrocyte recruitment could be modified by extra- and intrathyroidal factors: for example, pretreatment of the mice with an iodine-deficient diet increased the maximal percentage of droplet containing cells to nearly 90%. Obviously, two separate components of the macropinocytotic response of the thyroid gland to TSH can be distinguished: the first is the gradually increasing fraction of droplet-containing cells, the second is the well known increase of the number of colloid droplets in each TSH-responsive cell with progressive TSH stimulation. Recruitment of thyrocytes with a gradually increasing natural threshold to a hormonal stimulus appears to be a fundamental mechanism in the thyroid gland and possibly in other organs.',\n",

Population age-specific reproduction rates for Rochester residents for the years 1935-1974 were estimated using the number of live births from the Minnesota Department of Health Statistics and Vital Statistics of the U.S. for comparison with rates in affected persons. Overall, fertility rates were significantly reduced to 80% of expected for affected males and 85% for affected females. Individuals with partial seizures (simple and complex) were disadvantaged, whereas those with generalized onset were not. During the last 20 years of the study period, males were more disadvantaged than females. The male-female difference was greatest during the time of low population fertility (after 1965). Male deficits were more marked after diagnosis; female deficits were more marked before diagnosis. Differences in the proportion of ever-married person-years between the sexes only partially explain the observed differences.',\n",

As a group, these children were making less academic progress than expected for their age and IQ level. Academic deficiencies were greatest in arithmetic, followed by spelling, reading, comprehension, and word recognition. Results of the multiple regression analyses indicated a modest combined predictive significance of the demographic and clinical seizure variables for academic performance. In addition, the magnitude of these relationships varied by academic area. Among the individual variables examined the strongest correlates of academic performance were age of the child, age of seizure onset, lifetime total seizure frequency, and presence of multiple seizures (absence and tonic-clonic). These results are discussed in relation to developing an understanding of the factors which underlie academic vulnerability in children with epilepsy.',\n",

This lack of correlation may be due to variations in the metabolic activity of the endometriotic implants present at different stages of the disease. Because prostaglandin F (PGF) has been implicated as a hormonal mediator of the clinical symptoms of endometriosis, PGF synthesis and content was measured in implants from 14 patients with mild, moderate, severe, or extensive disease. To assess whether PGF production was related to the status of implants, the authors classified implants, based on gross and histologic criteria, as petechial or reddish; intermediate or brown; or powder-burn or black. PGF production of implants from patients with mild or moderate disease was greater than that of implants from patients with severe or extensive disease (P less than 0.05), and PGF content was similar for all stages of endometriosis. Petechial implants produced twice the amount of PGF than intermediate implants (P less than 0.05), which in turn produced more PGF than powder-burn implants (P less than 0.05). Powder-burn implants did not have the in vitro capacity to produce PGF, and the amount of PGF contained in implants of all classes was similar. Therefore, endometriotic implant PGF production and possibly other biochemical activities are dependent on the physical status of the implant. The classification of implants by morphologic appearance may afford additional assistance in determining the prognosis of the disease and in the examination of the subtle effects of the disease on symptoms.',\n",

The subsequent histories of 144 women who did not return for surgery were examined, to determine whether failure to return might have screened, selectively, the women at greatest risk of regret.

The hCG curves of 151 singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of two, three, and four embryos therefore were compared statistically with the hCG curves of singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of only one embryo. The hCG levels of singleton IVF pregnancies achieved by transfer of more than one embryo had statistically higher hCG levels at 7 and 8, 19 and 20, and 37 and 38 days after ET. In a separate evaluation it was observed that declines in hCG levels of normal singleton IVF pregnancies preceded four of five first-trimester abortion incidence peaks of singleton IVF pregnancies.

Some cases of duct occlusion are suitable for reconstructive surgery. The authors describe a reconstructive technique based on full mobilization of a single loop of the epididymal duct as caudally as possible with two-layer side-to-end anastomosis to the vas deferens. To ensure follow-up evaluation of each anastomosis, unilateral anastomosis was done primarily. In a few cases, cross-over anastomosis was necessary. In cases of reoperation, if possible, this was performed on the same side. When the epididymal duct system was found empty, the contralateral epididymis was explored. Patients with postoperative oligozoospermia were offered a supplementary contralateral operation. From 1980 to 1984, 41 patients underwent epididymovasostomy. At follow-up evaluation, 35 (85%) presented sperms in repeated tests. Fifteen of these patients (37%) have fathered children.

The samples were subjected to multiple exposure photography (four picture frames of two different drops) at 0, 1, 4, or 5 and at 10 hours and sperm motility and velocity were analyzed. In both calcium and calcium-creatine phosphate conditions, sperm motility and velocity were significantly increased, compared with control values (P = between less than 0.001 and 0.05). Sperm motility declined following Verapamil exposure, but the motility values remained at the level of the control in the presence of additional calcium or creatine phosphate. The effects of calcium and creatine phosphate take place rapidly; within 1 minute all improvements in sperm velocity and motility are fully achieved. There is no loading effect of calcium, and when the sperm is transferred into media without the additional calcium, the velocity decreased to that of the initial control value. Magnesium alone had no effect on motility or velocity. These experiments indicate that calcium or creatine phosphate can support sperm motility and velocity at a significantly increased level. Thus the addition of calcium or creatine phosphate to the insemination media may enhance the fertilizing capacity of sperm during in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer procedures.',\n",

The administration of alpha 1-blocker and beta-stimulator elicited an increase in sperm output and seminal volume in 16 patients (80%).

Biweekly colonoscopic biopsies of the descending colon were performed for 29 wk in control and dimethylhydrazine-treated rats. Biopsy specimens of the splenic flexure, rectum, and any visualized tumors were taken. The specimens were stained with periodic acid-Schiff to detect neutral mucins, high-iron diamine alcian blue to detect sialylated and sulfated mucins, fluoresceinated peanut agglutinin, and fluoresceinated Ulex europeus agglutinin. None of the first three tests consistently detected premalignant mucosa. However, Ulex europeus agglutinin, which bound to only 3% of control biopsy specimens throughout the course of the study, bound to increasing numbers of biopsy specimens in the dimethylhydrazine-treated animals, reaching a maximum of 90% positivity by 13-16 wk. Moreover, Ulex europeus agglutinin bound strongly to all biopsy specimens from tissues adjacent to tumors and to 93% of tumors. Mucosal atrophy and focal dysplasia were present more frequently in specimens taken from the rectum (but not the splenic flexure) of dimethylhydrazine-treated animals than of control animals, but there was no correlation between the histochemical markers and either atrophy or dysplasia. We conclude that Ulex europeus agglutinin binding is a consistent feature of premalignant colonic mucosa in dimethylhydrazine-treated rats.',\n",

Results of this study indicate that pretreatment of male F344 rats with the calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem, or Mg2+ significantly protected against ethanol- and indomethacin-induced gastric lesions as demonstrated by gross and histopathologic evaluation. Treatment of rats with calcium channel blockers before ethanol or indomethacin administration resulted in a significant decline in the mean number of lesions per glandular stomach, the damaged area of the glandular stomach, and the severity of lesions. Calcium channel blockers also caused a significant decline in the incidence of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions, but had no effect on the incidence of ethanol-induced gastric lesions. These results offer the first evidence that calcium channel blockers may play an important role in the protection against chemically induced gastric lesions and thereby offer insight into the mechanism of gastric ulcer formation. It is speculated that this knowledge may prove important in the development of new and improved therapies for the treatment and prevention of gastric ulcers in humans.',\n",

Nonpancreatic lipolytic activity was measured in gastric and duodenal aspirates from 5 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency secondary to alcoholism and in aspirates from 5 alcoholics without evidence of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction (controls). Samples were collected under fasting and postprandial conditions. All patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency had nonpancreatic lipolytic activity in gastric and duodenal aspirates. Lipolytic activity in gastric aspirates was not significantly different between the patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and the controls during the fasting and postprandial periods. Pancreatic insufficiency was associated with significantly (p less than 0.05) higher nonpancreatic lipolytic activity in the duodenum under fasting conditions. No significant difference between the groups was found in postprandial nonpancreatic lipolytic activity. Nonpancreatic lipolytic activity accounted for approximately 90% of total lipolytic activity at the ligament of Treitz in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as opposed to 7% in the control subjects.

In this report, we describe diffuse and severe ultrastructural damage to the capillaries of the gastric glandular mucosa of the rat that occurred within 1 min after intragastric instillation of 100% ethanol. There was a gradient of damage in that endothelial cell structure was most severely disrupted in profiles of capillaries located close to the luminal surface but some morphologic evidence of damage was evident in the wall of capillary profiles to a mean depth of 256 micron. Capillary structure was generally normal in the deeper regions of the mucosa. Pretreatment with intragastric cysteamine, 30 mg/100 g, or intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.5 mg/100 g, significantly reduced the depth in the mucosa to which damage to capillaries extended. Pretreatment with intragastric prostaglandin F2 beta, 0.2 mg/100 g, afforded no significant protection. We conclude that a 1-min exposure to 100% ethanol induces striking damage to the microcirculation of glandular mucosa of the rat stomach with severe damage to capillary profiles near the lumen and sparing of capillary profiles near the muscularis mucosa, and pretreatment with the sulfhydryl agent, cysteamine, or with a large dose of prostaglandin F2 beta reduces the extent of but does not abolish ethanol-induced damage to gastric mucosal capillaries.',\n",
       " '87055089': 'To determine if hiatus hernia (HH) contributes to the delayed clearance of acid from the esophagus in patients with gastroesophageal reflux (GER), we performed simultaneous esophageal pH recordings and radionuclide studies in three study populations: 12 GER patients with HH, 5 GER patients with no HH, and 8 subjects with HH but no GER symptoms. Acid clearance was measured at 5 cm. above the manometrically located lower esophageal sphincter (LES) after injecting a 15-ml. bolus of 0.1 N HCl at 15 cm. above the LES. The acid was labeled with 200 mu Ci of 99mTc-sulfur colloid. Acid clearance was also measured at 10 cm. above the LES after injection of a 15-ml. bolus of 0.1 N HCl at 20 cm. above the LES. Acid clearance at 5 cm. above the LES was faster in GER patients with no HH compared to GER patients with HH and asymptomatic HH subjects. Acid clearance was faster at 10 cm. than 5 cm. above the LES in all HH and non-HH subjects studied. In non-HH subjects, each swallow resulted in an increase in pH (a monophasic pH response) at 5 and 10 cm. above the LES. In symptomatic as well as asymptomatic HH subjects, swallows resulted in an initial fall followed by a rise in pH at 5 cm. above the LES (a biphasic pH response). Radionuclide studies showed reflux of the isotope-labeled acid into the esophagus followed by clearance (a biphasic response) accompanying swallows in 15 of the 20 HH subjects. Swallow-induced reflux was not detected by radionuclide scanning in non-HH subjects. Based on these observations, we conclude that during acid clearance a small amount of acid is trapped in the HH sac and refluxes into the esophagus during subsequent swallows when there is relaxation of the LES, and these repeated episodes of acid reflux from the HH account for the delayed acid clearance observed in GER patients with HH.',\n",
       " '87055090': 'The influence of the peptide chain length of partial enzymic hydrolysates of protein on nitrogen and amino acid absorption was studied in 12 subjects using a jejunal perfusion technique. Three hydrolysates of egg white and an equivalent amino acid mixture were perfused at 30 mmol/L and 100 mmol/L in two separate experiments. Two hydrolysates (OH1 and OH2) contained mainly dipeptides and tripeptides, whereas the third (OH3) comprised tripeptide to pentapeptides as judged chromatographically. Nitrogen absorption was significantly slower from the higher chain length mixture, OH3, than from the short chain mixtures, OH1 and OH2, at both concentrations. Similarly, several amino acid residues were absorbed less well from OH3 than from OH1 and OH2. These data demonstrate that the chain length of heterogeneous mixtures of peptides affects absorption of nitrogen and individual amino acid residues, and suggest that brush border hydrolysis of tetrapeptides and pentapeptides limits absorption from enzymic hydrolysates of protein which simulate the composition of the postprandial luminal contents.',\n",

The alpha-epitope was localized to the pepsin region of the molecules. The two major alpha-PG I isozymogens (Pg 3 alpha and Pg 5 alpha) and the major beta-PG I isozymogen (Pg 4 beta) were demonstrated to contain net charge differences located in the respective pepsin and activation peptide regions.

In normal subjects fecal excretion of the radiolabel was increased with increasing stool volumes. As a group, patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea excreted radiolabeled bile acid more rapidly than normal subjects with induced diarrhea (t1/2 56 +/- 8 vs. 236 +/- 60 h, respectively, p less than 0.005). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between t1/2 of radiolabeled bile acid and Schilling test results in these patients. Although 14 of 17 patients absorbed labeled taurocholic acid less well than any of the normal subjects with comparable volumes of induced diarrhea, cholestyramine had no statistically significant effect on stool weight in the patient group, and in none of the patients was stool weight reduced to within the normal range. In summary, most patients with idiopathic chronic diarrhea have bile acid malabsorption (as measured by fecal excretion of labeled bile acid), but they do not respond to cholestyramine therapy with a significant reduction in stool weight. Although the significance of these findings was not clearly established, the most likely interpretation is that bile acid malabsorption is a manifestation of an underlying intestinal motility or absorptive defect rather than the primary cause of diarrhea.',\n",

Cisapride (5 mg) was given intravenously 15 min before ingestion of a 400-kcal test meal and 10 indigestible solid radiopaque markers. On separate days and in random order each patient also received intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) or placebo 15 min before ingestion of the meal and markers. Mean gastric emptying of radiopaque markers, assessed by serial radiographs of the gastric region, was accelerated by metoclopramide and cisapride, but the difference reached significance only with cisapride (p less than 0.05). There was considerable intersubject variability in gastric emptying responses to cisapride and metoclopramide. No side effects occurred with either drug.

In circular and longitudinal ileal smooth muscle, tetrodotoxin was used to separate direct from neurally mediated contractile effects. Cholecystokinin receptors on smooth muscle cells were found in all locations. The muscle cells displayed a decreasing order of sensitivity to the C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin as expressed in the median doses, and to the selective cholecystokinin antagonist, proglumide, as expressed in the inhibitory dissociation constants. The median doses of the octapeptide of cholecystokinin ranged from 5.5 nM in gallbladder muscle to 185 nM in circular ileal muscle; the corresponding inhibitory dissociation constants of proglumide ranged from 180 to 437 microM [corrected]. Cholecystokinin receptors on cholinergic neurons were confined to circular and longitudinal ileal muscle; the neurons were 80-300 times more sensitive to the octapeptide of cholecystokinin (D50's 0.5 and 2.3 nM) than the corresponding muscle cells, and 19-21 times more sensitive to proglumide (inhibitory dissociation constants, 20 microM [corrected]).

Systemic plasma levels of testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone were significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced, whereas those of androstenedione, estrone, and estradiol were significantly (p less than 0.05) elevated in men with alcoholic cirrhosis when compared to controls. Sex hormone binding globulin levels were also significantly elevated (p less than 0.01). The hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the degree of liver function impairment as shown by the linear significant relationship between their hepatic extractions and that of indocyanine green (r = 0.74-0.92, p less than 0.05; except for dihydrotestosterone, r = 0.17, not significant). In addition, the hepatic uptake of sex steroids depended on the binding affinity to sex hormone binding globulin. The higher the affinity for sex hormone binding globulin, the lower the hepatic uptake influenced by liver function impairment. It was estimated that hepatic clearances accounted for only 20%-50% of the metabolic clearance of sex steroids. No significant relationship between plasma levels of sex steroids and their hepatic clearance was found. We show here that in alcoholic cirrhosis the extent of hepatic uptake of sex steroids depends partly on the degree of liver function impairment and partly on the degree to which they are bound to sex hormone binding globulin. Production rate or peripheral metabolism, or both, rather than hepatic uptake alone may account for the altered circulating levels of sex steroids.',\n",

Twenty-four patients (36%) sustained remission for at least 5 yr (mean, 11 +/- 0.6 yr) after initial therapy, and 42 (64%) relapsed and were retreated. Patients who sustained remission had shorter durations of illness before therapy (8 +/- 1 vs. 14 +/- 2 mo, p less than 0.05) and they had greater laboratory improvements during treatment. The frequencies of cirrhosis and death were not significantly greater in patients who relapsed. Of the 42 patients who relapsed, 9 (21%) ultimately entered a sustained remission after retreatment.

Three sets of distinctive markers were ingested by 24 healthy persons on 3 successive days. In the first part of the study, daily abdominal x-rays were taken and individual stools were collected for radiography. Mouth-to-anus transits were assessed from the fecal output of markers and mean colonic and segmental colonic transits were calculated from the daily radiographs. These established methods were then compared with estimates of total colonic and segmental transits based on a single abdominal film, taken on the fourth day. The single-film technique correlated well with values obtained from the previous, but more inconvenient, methods. Using the simpler approach, colonic transit was assessed in 49 additional healthy subjects, for a total group of 73. Total colonic transit was 35.0 +/- 2.1 h (mean +/- SE); segmental transits was 11.3 +/- 1.1 h for the right colon, 11.4 +/- 1.4 h for the left colon, and 12.4 +/- 1.1 h for the rectosigmoid. Men had significantly shorter transits for the whole colon than did women (p less than 0.05), and this difference was apparent to some extent in the right (p = 0.06) and left colon (p = 0.07) but not in the rectosigmoid.

Reovirus type 1 adherence to the surface of villus and dome epithelial cells showed marked variation in 2-6-day-old animals, but by 7 days only a few absorptive cell profiles had adherent reovirus. Adherence to greater than 50% of M-cell profiles occurred in all but 2 animals, but adherence to the majority of Peyer's patch absorptive cell profiles was present only in some 4- and 5-day-old animals. Adherence to a majority of undifferentiated cell profiles occurred in some animals at all ages. Membranous epithelial cells endocytosed reovirus at all ages but only at 2 days did rare villus and dome absorptive cells endocytose reovirus into the apical cytoplasm. Thus, adherence of reovirus to the apical surface of mucosal epithelial cells is nonselective in newborn mice but becomes more selective within the first postnatal week with adherence by day 7 to most M-cell profiles, to a substantial but variable number of undifferentiated cell profiles, but to few absorptive cell profiles.\",\n",

Fifteen fasted healthy human subjects were seated inside a circular vection drum, the rotation of which produces visual signals of self-motion that are in conflict with vestibular signals (i.e., mismatched sensory input). An electrogastrogram was obtained for three 15-min. periods: baseline, rotation, and after drum rotation stopped. Respiration, symptoms volunteered by subjects, and a continuous measure of intensity of symptoms were recorded. Five subjects showed a continuation of normal 3-cycles/min. activity during drum rotation and reported no symptoms of motion sickness. Ten subjects showed a shift of their dominant gastric frequency from 3 cycles/min. to 4-9 cycles/min. during drum rotation and reported symptoms of motion sickness. Running spectral analysis revealed a close correspondence over time between tachygastria and reports of symptoms of motion sickness.',\n",

We studied oesophageal motor activity in 30 consecutive patients meeting standard diagnostic criteria for primary anorexia nervosa (Feighner et al; DSM III). Seven were found to suffer from achalasia instead of primary anorexia nervosa, one from diffuse oesophageal spasm and one from severe gastro-oesophageal reflux and upper oesophageal sphincter hypertonicity, while partly non-propulsive and repetitive high amplitude, long duration contractions prevailed in the lower oesophagus of another six. In four patients with oesophageal dysmotility not responding to therapy and in 12 of 15 patients with normal oesophageal manometry, gastric emptying of a semisolid meal was studied. Emptying was normal in only three but markedly delayed in 13 cases (half emptying times 97-330 min, median: 147 min, as compared with 21-119 min, median: 47 min, in 24 healthy controls). In eight patients, the effects of domperidone 10 mg iv and placebo were compared under random double blind conditions. Half emptying times were shortened significantly (p less than 0.01) by domperidone. Conclusions: symptoms of disordered upper gastrointestinal motor activity may be mistaken as indicating primary anorexia nervosa; clinical evaluation of patients with presumed primary anorexia nervosa should rule out the possibility that disordered oesophageal motor activity underlies the symptoms; delayed gastric emptying is a frequent feature in primary anorexia nervosa and might be returned to normal with domperidone.',\n",

Nine patients had macroscopic endoscopic changes and a further 11 biopsy changes alone, of oesophagitis which was thus present in 80% overall. Lower oesophageal sphincter pressure was significantly less in irritable bowel patients than in age and sex matched controls, but upper oesophageal sphincter pressure was comparable in the two groups and disordered peristalsis was not found. Oesophageal symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome are mainly caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux predisposed to by a subnormal lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, rather than by oesophageal spasm.',\n",

Cimetidine and ranitidine at 320 and 1000 micrograms/ml inhibited ACTH-stimulated corticosterone and cortisol synthesis and cimetidine decreased basal cortisol synthesis. The inhibitory effects of cimetidine on cortisol synthesis were approximately 10 times greater than those of ranitidine. Cimetidine (1000 micrograms/ml), but not ranitidine increased deoxycorticosterone synthesis by ACTH-stimulated cells, indicating inhibition of 11 beta-hydroxylation in the adrenal steroidogenic pathway.

Sham feeding induced a significant increase in gastric acid secretion from 1.29 to 7.73 mmol/h (p less than 0.02). Jejunal absorption of water decreased significantly from 41.0 to 26.8 ml/30cm/h (p less than 0.02), sodium from 2.60 to 0.74 mmol/30cm/h (p less than 0.05, and chloride from 2.68 to 0.74 mmol/30cm/h (p less than 0.02). During the hour after sham feeding gastric acid secretion and jejunal absorption returned towards basal values.

One subject showed malabsorption after a 10 g dose and possibly also 5 g fructose. In contrast, no malabsorption could be detected in any of the 10 subjects after ingestion of 100 g, 75 g, or 50 g sucrose or a mixture of 50 g glucose and 50 g fructose. After ingestion of mixtures of 50 g fructose +25 g glucose and 50 g fructose +12.5 g glucose malabsorption was present in three and seven subjects, respectively. Symptoms during all challenges were mild, or absent. It is concluded that in the healthy state the absorption capacity of fructose given alone ranges from less than 5 g to more than 50 g. The absorption capacity of fructose given as sucrose is much higher. Glucose stimulates fructose uptake in a dose dependent fashion. The possible existence of more than one intestinal transport system for fructose is considered. The elucidation of the clinical relevance of the findings is important.',\n",

We tested the value of this sign by comparing two groups: 100 patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis, and 300 control patients without signs of liver disease or portal hypertension. This endoscopic pattern was observed in 94 of the patients with cirrhosis, whereas oesophageal varices were seen in 78 only. In contrast, only one patient of the control group had this aspect. Moreover, this sign was also found in seven of eight patients with non cirrhotic portal hypertension, but was seen neither in 100 patients with chronic alcoholism but without liver disease, nor in 10 cirrhotic patients with end-to-side portacaval shunts. These endoscopic changes might be because of mucosal and/or submucosal oedema and congestion highlighting the normal areae gastricae pattern and related to raised portal pressure.

Limitations of plasma exchange, however, exist. Membrane plasma filtration provides a practical alternative. Solute removal can be made selective by the choice of operating conditions as temperature and the selection of the membrane/module design. The optimal temperature range is a function of the plasma type, solute concentrations and membrane system. Operation at below physiologic temperature (cryofiltration) is particularly suited for the removal of cold aggregative solutes, while operation at near or above physiologic temperature is more suited for the separation of solutes having large size differences at normal physiologic temperature. Membrane filtration is simple and safe to perform, is more selective than plasma exchange, does not require plasma product infusion and is more versatile than selective sorption in its applications.',\n",

Capillaries are known to be heavily recruited in the dependent lung, but there are no direct data that bear on how capillary transit times might be affected by gravity. We directly determined mean capillary transit times on the surface of the upper, middle, and lower lung by measuring the passage of fluorescent dye through the capillaries using in vivo television microscopy. In anesthetized dogs, mean capillary transit times averaged 12.3 s in the upper lung, 3.1 s in the midlung, and 1.6 s in the lower lung. This near order of magnitude variation in speed of blood transit establishes that there is a vertical gradient of capillary transit times in the lung. As expected, dependent capillary networks were nearly fully recruited, whereas relatively few capillaries were perfused in the upper lung. The lengthy transit times and sparsely perfused capillary beds in the upper lung combine to provide a substantial part of pulmonary gas exchange reserve.',\n",
       " '87056728': 'Previous investigation in normal humans has demonstrated reduced ventilation and ventilatory responses to chemical stimuli during sleep. Most have interpreted this to be a product of decreasing central nervous system sensitivity to the normal stimuli that maintain ventilation, whereas other factors such as increasing airflow resistance could also contribute to this reduction in respiration. To improve our understanding of these events, we measured ventilation and occlusion pressures (P0.1) during unstimulated ventilation and rebreathing-induced hypercapnia during wakefulness and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Eighteen subjects (10 males and 8 females) of whom seven were snorers (5 males and 2 females) were studied. Ventilation was reduced during both NREM and REM sleep (P less than 0.05), but this decrement in minute ventilation tended to be greater in snorers than nonsnorers. Unstimulated P0.1, on the other hand, was maintained or increased during sleep in all groups studied, with males and snorers showing the largest increase. The hypercapnic ventilatory response fell during both NREM and REM sleep and tended to be lower during REM than NREM sleep. However, the P0.1 response to hypercapnia during NREM sleep was well maintained at the waking level although the REM response was statistically reduced. These studies suggest that the mechanism of the reduction in ventilation and the hypercapnic ventilatory response seen during sleep, particularly NREM sleep, is likely to be multifactorial and not totally a product of decreasing central respiratory drive.',\n",

As a reference, we first examined MAdi during \"tonic\" REMS, since breathing is fairly regular in this state. \"Control\" ranges for peak amplitude (PEMG), inspiratory time (TI), duration of postinspiratory inspiratory activity, expiratory time, and the calculated inspiratory slope (PEMG/TI) were determined by overlaying individual breath traces of the time course of MAdi during tonic REMS to form a composite tracing. Next, the time course of the EMG during individual breaths in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and a complete period of consecutive breaths in REMS (both tonic and phasic) were compared with this tonic REMS composite. The number of eye movements per breath was tabulated as an index of phasic activity. The inspiratory slopes during SWS and tonic REMS were similar. However, during phasic REMS, many breaths displayed either increases (excitation) or decreases (inhibition) in slope compared with the \"typical\" breaths seen in tonic REMS. The occurrence of these altered slopes increased with the frequency of phasic events. TI was inversely related to the slope of the EMG, which tended to minimize changes in PEMG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)',\n",

Decreases in isoproterenol-stimulated (1 microM) cAMP accumulation were evident in adipocytes from trained normotensive rats but not in adipocytes from trained SHR. Basal and agonist-induced lipolysis in fat cells isolated from both normotensive rats and SHR immediately following a 60-min run was increased in both sedentary and trained rats. Adenylate cyclase activity in fat cell membranes was blunted in sedentary and trained SHR both in the absence and presence of 100 microM 5'-guanylyl imidophosphate. No apparent differences existed in antagonist affinity of binding sites for the antagonist dihydroalprenolol in normal rats or SHR. Evidence for a change in affinity of agonist isoproterenol might be indicated based on the enhanced potency of isoproterenol to stimulate lipolysis in trained normal rats. beta-Adrenergic receptor density and antagonist affinity were not different in normotensive rats and SHR in response to training. However, displacement of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in adipocytes from SHR required greater concentrations of isoproterenol compared with adipocytes from normotensive rats, further suggestive of increased agonist affinity of binding sites in normal rats.

Both total breath iEMG and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) increased, remained at a high level for a certain period of time, and then started to fall. A change in the pattern of iEMG within a breath was observed during loaded breathing. The increase in total-breath iEMG was associated mostly with an increase in iEMG3, or the last part of the EMG power within each inspiration. Similarly, the decrease in total breath iEMG was primarily due to a decrease in iEMG3. We conclude that, in sheep subjected to severe IFR loads for prolonged periods the marked increase in total-breath iEMG at the beginning of loaded breathing and the marked decrease in this iEMG at the time of decrease in Pdi are largely due to changes in iEMG that occur during the latter third of each breath. We speculate that during loaded breathing the recruitment pattern of diaphragmatic muscle fibers changes during the course of an inspiratory effort.',\n",

We have studied the effect of electrical field stimulation (EFS), exogenous VIP, and isoproterenol (Iso) on human airways in vitro. We have also studied a related peptide, peptide histidine methionine (PHM), which coexists with VIP in human airway nerves, and in separate experiments studied fragments of the VIP amino acid sequence (VIP1-10 and VIP16-28) for agonist and antagonist activity. Human airways were obtained at thoracotomy and studied in an organ bath. In bronchi EFS gave an inhibitory response that was unaltered by 10(-6) M propranolol but was blocked by tetrodotoxin, whereas in bronchioles there was little or no nonadrenergic inhibitory response. VIP, PHM, and Iso all caused dose-dependent relaxation of bronchi, VIP and PHM being approximately 50-fold more potent than Iso. VIP, but not Iso, mimicked the time course of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerve stimulation. In contrast bronchioles relaxed to Iso but not to VIP or PHM. Neither propranolol nor indomethacin altered the relaxant effects of VIP or PHM, suggesting a direct effect of these peptides on airway smooth muscle. Neither of the VIP fragments showed either agonist or antagonist activity. We conclude that VIP and PHM are more potent bronchodilators of human bronchi than Iso and that the association between the relaxant effects of these peptides and nonadrenergic inhibitory responses suggests that they may be possible neurotransmitters of nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves in human airways.',\n",
       " '87056735': 'Newborn rats were maintained in an hypoxic chamber (10% O2 in N2) from the day of birth up to 2 wk of postnatal life. Body weight (BW) and nose-tail length were less in the hypoxic exposed (H) rats than in control (C) animals growing in air. Hematocrit rose from about 37% to about 51%. Oxygen consumption (VO2), measured with a manometric method, was lower in H than in C rats; the difference remained at 5-7 days even after normalization by BW. At 5-7 days ventilation, measured with an airflow plethysmograph, was much more elevated in H rats (whether breathing 10% O2 or air) than in C rats, with an increase in both tidal volume and frequency. This indicates that the biphasic ventilatory response, characterized by an initial rise and then a fall of ventilation toward normoxic values, commonly observed in newborns during acute hypoxic challenge is an immediate but only transient response. The dry lung weight-to-BW ratio and alveolar size were larger in H than in C rats. Lung volumes at 20 cmH2O were similar, despite the smaller BW of the H rats. Hence, in the rat, chronic hypoxia in the immediate postnatal period increases O2-carrying capacity, decreases metabolic demands, increases alveolar O2 availability, and promotes structural changes in the lung that protect the gas exchange area and optimize the structure-function relationship of the lung. These results may also suggest that the lung structural alterations with chronic hypoxia should not be attributed to changes in VO2 but, eventually, to the ventilatory action of the organ.',\n",

Stimulation of the phrenic nerve at three and five times threshold, which activated groups I, II, and a few group III fibers, had no effect on any of the variables measured. Stimulation at 20 times threshold, which activated many group III fibers and groups I and II fibers, reflexly decreased resistance. Stimulation at 70, 140, and 200 times threshold, which activated groups I-IV fibers, evoked progressively greater decreases in lung resistance. The reflex bronchodilation evoked by phrenic nerve stimulation was unaffected by propranolol or phentolamine but was abolished by atropine.

The adaptive response to submaximal exercise (cycling at 150-175 W) in anemia was mediated to the amount of 50% by an increase in cardiac output (mainly an increase in heart rate) and 50% was due to increased O2 extraction in the peripheral tissue.

The lungs were initially equilibrated with 1% ethane, and then the concentration of ethane was monitored by mass spectrometry from multiple anatomic sites along the tracheobronchial tree during washout. We observed that the lung changed from a uniform distribution of ethane concentrations to a nonuniform distribution by a three-phase process. The first phase was nearly complete within the first 15 s and probably corresponds to concentration gradients being established in the central airways. During the second phase of washout, which lasted for several minutes, the concentrations in the various alveolar regions diverged. In the final phase, the regional concentrations remained at fixed ratios, and washout from all sites in the lung was at a constant fractional rate.

Inspiratory pressures were measured with an esophageal balloon catheter and three catheters located at different sites along the upper airway: supralaryngeal airway, oropharynx, and nasopharynx. Peak inspiratory pressure differences between catheters allowed assessment of pressure gradients across three airway segments: lungs-larynx-retroepiglottal airway (esophageal-supralaryngeal pressure), hypopharynx (supralaryngeal-oropharynx pressure), and transpalatal airway (oropharynx-nasopharynx pressure). In five patients, hypopharyngeal obstruction was present, and in four patients no hypopharyngeal obstruction existed. In these four patients the site of obstruction was located at the level of the palate. In a given subject, the site of obstruction was the same during repeated measurements. The presence or absence of hypopharyngeal narrowing during sleep was not predictable from gradients measured across different segments of the upper airway during wakefulness.

In addition to standard polysomnography for sleep staging and respiratory pattern monitoring, esophageal pressure, tidal volume (VT), and airflow were measured via an esophageal catheter and pneumotachograph, respectively, with the latter attached to a tight-fitting face mask, allowing calculation of total pulmonary system resistance (Rp). During stage I/II NREM sleep minimal period breathing was evident in two of the subjects; however, in four subjects during hypoxia and/or relief from hypoxia, with and without added resistance, pronounced periodic breathing developed with waxing and waning of VT, sometimes with apneic phases. Resistive loading without hypoxia did not cause periodicity. At the nadir of periodic changes in VT, Rp was usually at its highest and there was a significant linear relationship between Rp and 1/VT, indicating the development of obstructive hypopneas. In one subject without added resistance and in the same subject and in another during resistive loading, upper airway obstruction at the nadir of the periodic fluctuations in VT was observed. We conclude that periodic breathing resulting in periodic diminution of upper airway muscle activity is associated with increased upper airway resistance that predisposes upper airways to collapse.',\n",

These results indicate that respiratory timing is continuously modified in patients with occlusive apnea as inspiratory neural drive fluctuates during NREM sleep and suggest that this modification is due to the net effects of changing inspiratory neural drive and afferent input predominantly from upper airway mechanoreceptors.',\n",
       " '87056753': 'The role of the epithelium has been studied in the contractile responses of rat trachea. The different modulations observed are discussed in respect to vagal components of the epithelial layer. Responses of rat trachea to immunologic stimulation are shown to be dependent on the presence of the epithelium, which prolongs the relaxation stage without affecting the contractions. This prolongation is abolished by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, whereas substance P induces a significantly greater relaxation of serotonin-precontracted intact than deepithelialized trachea. Serotonin concentration-response curves are shifted to the right in intact preparations, which is partly reversed by neonatal capsaicin pretreatment, but a hyporeactivity of the tissue exists. A relaxing factor released by the epithelium is hypothesized, possibly dependent on substance P-ergic innervation. Muscarinic cholinergic innervation slightly modulates the contractions but not the relaxations in antigen-induced responses, independently on the presence of the epithelial layer. 4-Aminopyridine induces epithelium-dependent potentiations of contractions to antigen and to serotonin, which involves acetylcholine at one step of the reaction cascade. Epithelial-dependent contracting and relaxing factors are thus suggested in rat trachea.',\n",
       " '87056754': 'In chronically catheterized rats hepatic glycogen was increased by fructose (approximately 10 g/kg) gavage (FF rats) or lowered by overnight food restriction (FR rats). [3-3H]- and [U-14C]glucose were infused before, during, and after treadmill running. During exercise the increase in glucose production (Ra) was always directly related to work intensity and faster than the increase in glucose disappearance, resulting in increased plasma glucose levels. At identical work-loads the increase in Ra and plasma glucose as well as liver glycogen breakdown were higher in FF and control (C) rats than in FR rats. Breakdown of muscle glycogen was less in FF than in C rats. Incorporation of [14C]glucose in glycogen at rest and mobilization of label during exercise partly explained that 14C estimates of carbohydrate metabolism disagreed with chemical measurements. In some muscles glycogen depletion was not accompanied by loss of 14C and 3H, indicating futile cycling of glucose. In FR rats a postexercise increase in liver glycogen was seen with 14C/3H similar to that of plasma glucose, indicating direct synthesis from glucose. In conclusion, in exercising rats the increase in glucose production is subjected to feedforward regulation and depends on the liver glycogen concentration. Endogenous glucose may be incorporated in glycogen in working muscle and may be used directly for liver glycogen synthesis rather than after conversion to trioses. Fructose ingestion may diminish muscular glycogen breakdown. The [14C]glucose infusion technique for determination of muscular glycogenolysis is of doubtful value in rats.',\n",

Airway responsiveness to antigen and histamine was characterized by the doses that increased the airflow resistance of the total respiratory system to twice the control values (ED200). Highly significant correlations were found between airway responsiveness and cutaneous responsiveness to antigen and other immunologic characteristics (e.g., IgE and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen) in all dogs. In ragweed-sensitized dogs, there was an inverse correlation between immunologic responsiveness (reflected by the cutaneous response to antigen and histamine released from lung by inhaled antigen) and nonimmunologic responsiveness of airways (histamine ED200: r = 0.73, P less than 0.05 and r = 0.75, P less than 0.01, respectively). Antigen ED200 was also correlated with histamine release from lung after antigen inhalation (r = 0.74; P less than 0.01). We conclude that airway reactions to inhaled antigen in allergic dogs are dependent not only on immunologic factors but also on the degree of nonimmunologic airway responsiveness to histamine and that these factors are correlated inversely.',\n",

       " '87056757': 'Several recent reports have addressed the problem of estimating the response slope from repeated measurements of paired data when both stimulus and response variables are subject to biological variability. These earlier approaches suffer from several drawbacks: useful information about the relationships between the error components in a closed-loop system is not fully utilized; the response intercept cannot be directly estimated; and the normalization procedure required in some methods may fail under certain circumstances. This paper proposes a new, general method of simultaneously estimating the response slope and intercept from corrupted stimulus-response data when the errors in both variables are specifically related by the system structure. A direct extension of the least-squares approach, this method [directed least squares (DLS)] reduces to ordinary least-squares methods when either of the measured variables is error free and to the reduced-major-axis (RMA) method of Kermack and Haldane (Biometrics 37: 30-41, 1950) when the magnitudes of the normalized errors are equal. The DLS estimators are scale invariant, statistically unbiased and always assume the minimum variance. With simple modifications, the method is also applicable to paired data. If, however, the relation between error components is uncertain, then the RMA method is optimal, i.e., having the least possible asymptotic bias and variance. These results are illustrated by using various types of closed-loop respiratory response data.',\n",
       " '87056758': 'We have reported previously that in ovalbumin-sensitized canine tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) the maximum ability to shorten is increased. This could account for the increased airway narrowing seen in vivo in allergic bronchoconstriction. It was associated with increased velocity of shortening. We now report that, by using an electromagnetic muscle lever system, quick releases were applied to control and sensitized TSM at 0.5-s intervals throughout the course of a lightly preloaded 10-s isotonic contraction. From the records obtained it is possible to determine that, early in contraction, shortening is brought about by relatively rapidly cycling [0.35 optimal muscle length units +/- 0.033/s (SE)] cross bridges. We also report that in the sensitized TSM it is the early bridges that increase their velocity by 26.6% (P less than 0.05) compared with similar bridges in muscles from control animals. Since 70% of the maximum shortening of the muscle occurs when early bridges are operative, it is likely that these bridges are responsible for the major part of the shortening. It is thus probable that increased allergic bronchoconstriction is produced by increased activity of early, rapidly cycling bridges. The bridges that are active late in the shortening show no difference between control and sensitized airway smooth muscles.',\n",

The highest values of the median frequency occurred at the region of the innervation zone and tendonous insertion of the muscle, and decreased proportionally with distance from these areas. The rate of change of median frequency was not effected by electrode location.

Respiratory air flow, esophageal pressure, and intramuscular GG electromyograms (EMG) were recorded during wakefulness and sleep. Both tonic and phasic inspiratory GG-EMG activity was recorded in each of the infants. On occasion, no phasic GG activity could be recorded; these silent periods were unassociated with respiratory embarrassment. GG activity increased during sigh breaths. GG activity also increased when the infants spontaneously changed from oral to nasal breathing and, in two infants, with neck flexion associated with complete upper airway obstruction, suggesting that GG-EMG activity is influenced by sudden changes in upper airway resistance. During sleep, the GG-EMG activity significantly increased with 5% CO2 breathing (P less than or equal to 0.001). With nasal airway occlusion during sleep, the GG-EMG activity increased with the first occluded breath and progressively increased during the subsequent occluded breaths, indicating mechanoreceptor and suggesting chemoreceptor modulation. During nasal occlusion trials, there was a progressive increase in phasic inspiratory activity of the GG-EMG that was greater than that of the diaphragm activity (as reflected by esophageal pressure excursions). When pharyngeal airway closure occurred during a nasal occlusion trial, the negative pressure at which the pharyngeal airway closed (upper airway closing pressure) correlated with the GG-EMG activity at the time of closure, suggesting that the GG muscle contributes to maintaining pharyngeal airway patency in the micrognathic infant.',\n",

Cyclic AMP-PDE kinetic plots according to Lineweaver-Burk for the calculation of Michaelis constants (Km) and maximum enzyme velocities (Vmax) were nonlinear, indicating both a low and high enzyme form. The Michaelis constants were significantly lower in trained rats than those of its control for the high Km form of cyclic AMP-PDE in the whole and soluble fractions and for the low Km form of the P5 particulate fraction. The Vmax of the high Km form of the P48 particulate fraction from trained animals was also significantly higher than that found in its control. Phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines in the various fractions was similar in both trained and sedentary animals. These changes in specific activity, Michaelis constants, and Vmax of cyclic AMP-PDE from crude homogenates of isolated fat cells from exercise trained animals may account for the decreased intracellular levels of cyclic AMP following catecholamine stimulation of isolated fat cells from trained rats.',\n",

This behavior was associated with the onset of hypothermia, with deep body temperature falling by up to about 3 degrees C, usually to a new, steady level. Both the length of time spent in the cooler environment and the degree of the hypothermia produced increased with the partial pressure of N2O or N2 used. The effects of N2O on behavioral thermoregulation and body temperature were reversible. There was a correlation between anesthetic potency and the ability of both gases to alter thermoregulation, suggesting that the effect of these agents on thermoregulation was caused by the same molecular interactions as those which underlie anesthesia.

Since systemic venous pressure (SVP) must be overcome before pulmonary lymph can flow, variations in SVP may affect lymph flow rate and therefore the rate of fluid accumulation within the lung. The importance of this issue is evident when one considers the variety of clinical interventions that increase SVP and promote pulmonary edema formation, such as volume infusion, positive-pressure ventilation, and various vasoactive drug therapies. We recorded pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), left atrial pressure (LAP), and SVP in chronic unanesthetized sheep. Occlusion balloons were placed in the left atrium and superior vena cava to control their respective pressures. The superior vena caval occluder was placed above the azygos vein so that bronchial venous pressure would not be elevated when the balloon was inflated. Three-hour experiments were carried out at various LAP levels with and without SVP being elevated to 20 mmHg. The amount of fluid present in the lung was determined by the wet-to-dry weight ratio method. At control LAP levels, no significant difference in lung fluid accumulation could be shown between animals with control and elevated SVP levels. When LAP was elevated above control a significantly greater amount of pulmonary fluid accumulated in animals with elevated SVP levels compared with those with control SVP levels.

The average active elastance and resistance of the respiratory system were, respectively, 64.0 cmH2O X l-1 and 5.4 cmH2O X l-1 X s.

However, the responses of both Rc and Rp fell progressively when sequential doses of nicotine greater than 256 micrograms/kg were administered.

Under conditions in which the vagi were cut and atropine administered, the responsiveness of nicotine was even further depressed. Combinations either of atropine and chlorpheniramine or atropine and phenoxybenzamine also completely blocked reactions to nicotine.

Since evaporative heat loss requirement during exercise with BB, as estimated from the energy balance equation, was also reduced 18%, compared with control exercise, we concluded that during BB the reduction in sweating at any Tes is the consequence of both a decrease in local Tsk and a direct effect on sweat gland.',\n",

The right control plantaris muscle in the tumor group was 63% heavier than the right control plantaris from the nontumor group; however, the proportion of body weight for plantaris was similar between the two groups. The effect of gastrocnemius ablation and tumor treatment on plantaris weight was additive, and the percent increase over the unoperated contralateral control side was similar between the two groups. These data demonstrate that skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurs in adult animals in which growth has been stimulated by a growth hormone-secreting tumor and could suggest that the muscle growth response caused by the tumor is operating by a mechanism different than work-induced hypertrophy.',\n",

Rib cage, as well as abdominal, strapping caused a significant decrease in vital capacity (respectively, -36 and -34%), total lung capacity (TLC) (-31 and -27%), functional residual capacity (FRC) (-28 and -28%), and expiratory reserve volume (-40 and -48%) and an increase in specific airway conductance (+24 and +30%) and in maximal expiratory flow at 50% of control TLC (+47 and +42%). The decrease of residual volume (RV) was significant (-12%) with rib cage strapping only. Abdominal strapping resulted in a minor overall increase in Rrs, whereas rib cage strapping produced a more marked increase at low frequencies; thus a frequency dependence of Rrs was induced. A similar pattern, but with lower absolute values, of Rrs was obtained by thoracic strapping when the subject was breathing at control FRC. Xrs was decreased, especially at low frequencies, with abdominal strapping and even more with thoracic strapping; thus the resonant frequency of the respiratory system was shifted toward higher frequencies. Partitioning Rrs and Xrs into resistance and reactance of lungs and chest wall demonstrated that the different effects of chest wall and abdominal strapping on Rrs and Xrs reflect changes mainly of chest wall mechanics.',\n",

Muscle fiber type proportions (I, IIa, and IIb), fiber areas and activities of several enzyme markers of different energy metabolic pathways were determined from a biopsy of the vastus lateralis. Results indicated that Caucasians had a higher percent type I (8%, P less than 0.01) and a lower percent type IIa (6.7%, P less than 0.05) fiber proportions than Africans. No significant differences were observed between the two racial groups in the type IIb fiber proportion or in the three fiber type areas. Enzymes catalyzing reactions in phosphagenic [creatine kinase (CK)] and glycolytic [hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] metabolic pathways had significantly higher activities (about 30-40%) in the Black African group than in the Caucasian group (P less than 0.01). No significant difference was noted in the activities of oxidative enzymes [malate dehydrogenase (MDH), oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH)]. Consequently, the PFK/OGDH ratio was significantly elevated in Africans (P less than 0.05). The racial differences observed between Africans and Caucasians in fiber type proportion and enzyme activities of the phosphagenic and glycolytic metabolic pathways may well result from inherited variation. These data suggest that sedentary male Black individuals are, in terms of skeletal muscle characteristics, well endowed for sport events of short duration.',\n",

The diaphragm was electrically stimulated with intramuscular electrodes. The transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) during supramaximal (50 V) 2-s stimulations applied over a frequency range of 10-100 Hz was measured with balloon catheters at functional residual capacity. Cardiac output was measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter and diaphragmatic blood flow (Qdi) by timed volume collections of left inferior venous effluent. The force generated by the sartorius muscle during electrical stimulations was studied concomitantly to Pdi. In 10 dogs (group A) 0.04 mg/kg of digoxin was infused in 10 min.

This study was designed to determine whether an impairment in diaphragmatic contractility was involved in the genesis of the diaphragmatic dysfunction observed after upper abdominal surgery. Five patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery were studied. The following measurements were performed before and 4 h after surgery: vital capacity (VC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Diaphragmatic function was also assessed using the ratio of changes in gastric pressure (delta Pga) over changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure (delta Pdi). Finally contractility of the diaphragm was determined by measuring the change in delta Pdi generated during bilateral electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerves (Pdi stim). Diaphragmatic dysfunction occurred in all the patients after upper abdominal surgery as assessed by a marked decrease in delta Pga/delta Pdi from 0.480 +/- 0.040 to -0.097 +/- 0.152 (P less than 0.01) 4 h after surgery compared with preoperative values. VC also markedly decreased after upper abdominal surgery from 3,900 +/- 630 to 2,060 +/- 520 ml (P less than 0.01) 4 h after surgery. In contrast, no change in FRC and Pdi stim was observed 4 h after surgery. In contrast, no change in FRC and Pdi stim was observed 4 h after upper abdominal surgery compared with the preoperative values. We conclude that contractility of the diaphragm is not altered after upper abdominal surgery, and diaphragmatic dysfunction is secondary to other mechanisms such as possible reflexes arising from the periphery (chest wall and/or peritoneum), which could inhibit the phrenic nerve output.',\n",

Glucose (Glc), E2, and hGH levels were determined from serial blood samples taken from an intravenous catheter. Glc did not change significantly during exercise, but different trends for the runners (increases) vs. controls (decreases) resulted in higher (P less than 0.01) postexercise levels in the runners. Resting hGH was higher (P less than 0.05) in the FRs and FCs than the MRs and MCs, respectively, and continued to be higher in the FCs (vs. MCs) during the first 30 min of exercise. The MRs achieved higher peak hGH levels and exhibited higher values than the MCs throughout exercise and recovery. There were no statistically significant training differences in the females. The strongest predictors for peak hGH were absolute work load and group (runners vs. controls), both of which combined accounted for 32-36% of the variability (P less than 0.01) in hGH response.

       " '87056802': 'When dog lung lobes were perfused at constant arterial inflow rate, occlusion of the venous outflow (VO) produced a rapid jump in venous pressure (Pv) followed by a slower rise in both arterial pressure (Pa) and Pv. During the slow rise Pa(t) and Pv(t) tended to converge and become concave upward as the volume of blood in the lungs increased. We compared the dynamic vascular volume vs. pressure curves obtained after VO with the static volume vs. pressure curves obtained by dye dilution. The slope of the static curve (the static compliance, Cst) was always larger than the slope of the dynamic curve (the dynamic compliance, Cdyn). In addition, the Cdyn decreased with increasing blood flow rate. When venous occlusion (VO) was followed after a short time interval by arterial occlusion (AO) such that the lobe was isovolumic, both Pa and Pv fell with time to a level that was below either pressure at the instant of AO. In an attempt to explain these observations a compartmental model was constructed in which the hemodynamic resistance and vascular compliance were volume dependent and the vessel walls were viscoelastic. These features of the model could account for the convergence and upward concavity of the Pa and Pv curves after VO and the pressure relaxation in the isovolumic state after AO, respectively. According to the model analysis, the difference between Cst and Cdyn and the flow dependence of Cdyn are due to wall viscosity and volume dependence of compliance, respectively. Model analysis also suggested ways of evaluating changes in the viscoelasticity of the lobar vascular bed. Hypoxic vasoconstriction that increased total vascular resistance also decreased Cst and Cdyn and appeared to increase the vessel wall viscosity.',\n",

During passive deflation, both parts of the diaphragm lengthened and abdominal cross-sectional area decreased. We subsequently used the relationship between costal and crural diaphragmatic length, respectively, and abdominal cross-sectional area during passive inflation-deflation to predict the length changes in the costal and crural diaphragm during quiet breathing before and after bilateral phrenicotomy. In the intact animal the inspiratory shortening in the crural diaphragm was almost invariably greater than predicted from the relationship during passive inflation. During inspiration after phrenicotomy the crural diaphragm invariably lengthened, whereas the costal diaphragm often shortened. In general there was a good correlation between the measured and predicted length change for the crural diaphragm (r = 0.72 before and 0.79 after phrenicotomy) and a poor one for the costal diaphragm (r = 0.05 before and 0.19 after phrenicotomy).',\n",

All lungs were perfused for 4.5 h at a constant rate of 100 ml X min-1 X kg-1. In control lungs, the left atrial pressure (Pla) was kept at atmospheric pressure. In experimental lungs, Pla was kept atmospheric except for a 50-min elevation to 18 mmHg midway through the perfusion. During this period of left atrial hypertension, pulmonary arterial pressure rose from 18 to 31 mmHg, lymph flow rose from 3 to 12 ml/h, and the lymph-to-plasma oncotic pressure ratio (pi L/pi P) fell from 0.7 to 0.48. After left atrial pressure was returned to control, pulmonary arterial pressure, lymph flow, and pi L/pi P all returned to control levels. The rate of weight gain after the return of left atrial pressure to control was also the same as that in the control group. However, during the period of left atrial hypertension 135 ml of fluid were filtered into the lung, and this large increase in lung weight remained after the pressure was lowered. The presence of this substantial excess lung water despite control values for vascular pressures, lymph flow, rate of weight gain, and pi L/pi P suggests that the absolute amount of lung water has little influence on the dynamic aspects of lung fluid balance. These results are consistent with a two-compartment model of the interstitial space, where only one of the compartments is readily drained by the lymphatics.',\n",

Heart rate response in normal subjects reveals considerable variability, reflected by a relatively broadband interbeat interval power spectrum. A reduction in this autonomically modulated variability would be predicted to cause a narrowing of the spectrum. We retrospectively analyzed data from 10 aerobically conditioned men (age range 35-49 yr) who had undergone orthostatic tolerance testing with lower body negative pressure pre-bed rest and after 7-10 days of bed rest, while on placebo and after intravenous atropine. Spectra were derived by Fourier analysis of 128 interbeat interval data sets. Spectral power was estimated by computing the root-mean-square (rms) values (mean +/- SD) for the band encompassing the 2nd to 64th harmonics from subjects with a sufficient number of beats: placebo rms is 93 +/- 33 ms for pre-bed rest and 84 +/- 38 ms for bed rest (NS, n = 6); atropine rms is 63 +/- 24 ms for pre-bed rest and 40 +/- 23 ms for bed rest (P less than 0.01; n = 7). These data suggest that atropine \"unmasks\" a deconditioning effect of bed rest in athletic men, evidenced by a reduction in interbeat interval spectral power not apparent with placebo.

The time course of effluent perfusate pH equilibration was measured in a stop-flow pH electrode apparatus. Pulmonary CO2 excretion (Vco2) was monitored by continuously recording expired CO2 concentration. The lungs were ventilated with room air and perfused at 37 degrees C with KRB prebubbled with 5% CO2- 20% O2- 75% N2. The results obtained show that both the low-molecular-weight inhibitors and PD's caused postcapillary pH disequilibria (delta pH) in effluent perfusate. However, only acetazolamide and Prontosil caused a reduction in Vco2. These results suggest that there is an intravascular CA, presumably associated with endothelial cell membranes, that is accessible to all inhibitors used and is responsible in part for equilibration of the CO2- HCO3- -H+ reactions in the perfusate but, under the conditions used, does not affect CO2 excretion; and there is an extravascular (possibly intracellular) CA that can be inhibited by low-molecular-weight inhibitors, is primarily responsible for enhanced CO2 transfer across the alveolar-capillary barrier (perhaps via facilitation of CO2 diffusion), and is in part responsible for pH equilibration.\",\n",
       " '87056809': \"Slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors have been hypothesized to be the afferents mediating the vagally dependent, volume-related prolongation of expiratory time (TE) during expiratory loading. It has been further suggested that the vagal component of this prolongation of TE is due to the temporal summation of pulmonary stretch receptor (PSR) activity during expiratory loading. This hypothesis was tested in rabbits exposed to resistive and elastic single-breath expiratory loading while PSR's were simultaneously recorded. Both types of loads resulted in a decreased expired volume (VE) and increased expiratory duration (TE). The TE for resistive loads were significantly greater than for elastic loads for equivalent VE. Thus two different VE-TE relationships were found for resistive and elastic loads. When TE was plotted against the area under the expired volume trajectory, a single linear relationship was observed. PSR activity recorded during expiratory loading increased as VE decreased and TE increased. A single linear relationship resulted when the number of PSR spikes during the expiration was plotted against the associated TE for all types of loads. These findings demonstrate that the volume-related prolongation of TE with single-breath expiratory loads is associated with an increase in PSR discharge. These results support the hypothesis that the vagal component of load-dependent prolongation of TE is a function of both the temporal and spatial summation of PSR activity during the expiratory phase.\",\n",

Two postures required full support of body weight by the arms: arms up, hanging from a bar, and arms down with hands gripping parallel bars. Three involved muscles that flex and extend the trunk: a partial sit-up position while supine and nearly maximal spinal extension and flexion while standing. Changes at the inspiratory and expiratory volume extremes were recognized by having the subjects do two VC efforts: the first standing and the second in the posture in question while continuing to breathe on the spirometer. Control observations in which the second of a VC pair was performed in an unstressed posture allowed correction for the influence of rebreathing. The changes in corrected VC were small, the greatest being an average reduction of approximately 8% in the partial sit-up position. During full support of body weight by the arms, the VC was slightly increased due to a significant increase in the inspiratory extreme and no change in the expiratory extreme. Spinal extension produced small increases in lung volume at both extremes with no significant change in VC, whereas spinal flexion did not influence the upper extreme but did increase lung volume at the lower extreme.

Diaphragmatic force output, as assessed by Pdi, followed the periodic changes in EMGdi but during the occlusive phase the increase in Pdi was more than the increase in EMGdi. This increase in Pdi was essentially due to an increase in Ppl, since Pga and EMGdi had a linear relationship (r = 0.98, P less than 0.001) that did not change during the occlusive and ventilatory phases. Abdominal muscle recruitment evident in Pga and abdominal motion tracings during the occlusive phase when paradoxical rib cage motion was observed suggested that this increase in diaphragmatic efficiency was likely due to a change in diaphragmatic length-tension characteristics. These results demonstrate that, in patients with occlusive apneas, the diaphragm is the predominant respiratory muscle during NREM sleep and that its function is supported by abdominal muscle recruitment.',\n",

In a second group, alpha-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to decrease O2 delivery by excessive vasoconstriction. In a third group, beta-adrenergic receptors were stimulated to increase O2 delivery.

The whole-body O2 deficit and excess O2 uptake in recovery were partitioned into muscle and nonmuscle areas. The data showed that neural or humoral influences had little effect on the regional distribution of the total O2 deficit and O2 excess in recovery. The O2 deficit could be decreased somewhat by increasing delivery, but the amount of excess O2 used in recovery was unaffected.

Pulmonary venous resistance (Rv) increased to a greater extent than arterial resistance (Ra) in both Ringer-perfused and blood-perused lungs challenged with LTC4.

Propranolol treatment beginning before high-altitude (4,300 m) ascent reduced heart rate during maximal and submaximal exercise in six healthy men treated with propranolol (80 mg three times daily) compared with five healthy subjects receiving placebo (lactose). Compared with sea-level values, the VO2max fell on day 2 at high altitude, but the magnitude of fall was similar in the placebo and propranolol treatment groups (26 +/- 6 vs. 32 +/- 5%, P = NS) and VO2max remained similar at high altitude in both groups once treatment was discontinued. During 30 min of submaximal (80% of VO2max) exercise, propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake levels that were as large as those in placebo subjects. The maintenance of maximal or submaximal levels of O2 uptake in propranolol-treated subjects at 4,300 m could not be attributed to increased minute ventilation, arterial O2 saturation, or hemoglobin concentration. Rather, it appeared that propranolol-treated subjects maintained O2 uptake by transporting a greater proportion of the O2 uptake with each heartbeat. Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, beta-adrenergic blockade did not impair maximal or submaximal O2 uptake at high altitude due perhaps to compensatory mechanisms acting to maintain stroke volume and cardiac output.',\n",

We conclude that the reinfusion of up to 3 U of autologous blood into highly trained endurance runners who have normal hematology does not adversely affect their cardiovascular response to maximal exercise. In addition, the increases in VO2max following reinfusion of 2 U, and again after 3 U, suggest that the aerobic power of the working muscles was not surpassed at these levels of erythrocythemia.',\n",
       " '87056824': 'Measurements of muscle pH (pHm) with the homogenate technique are routinely made when extensive phosphagen hydrolysis has occurred. Upon exposure of the homogenate to 37 degrees C in the pH meter, phosphocreatine and ATP were rapidly degraded to 35 and 60% of control concentrations after 30 s. Attempts at chemically arresting this hydrolysis were unsuccessful. Therefore we examined the significance of phosphagen hydrolysis on pHm measurement in human biopsies taken at rest and following intense electrical stimulation. To accomplish this, pHm was measured at 0 degree C, where extensive hydrolysis did not occur. On the same homogenate, pHm was measured at 0 degree C with phosphagens and at 0 and 37 degrees C after phosphagen hydrolysis. The effect of phosphagen hydrolysis on pHm at 0 degrees C was used to estimate this effect at 37 degrees C. In resting samples, phosphagen hydrolysis produced a nonsignificant acidification of 0.008 pH units and, in electrically stimulated samples, a nonsignificant alkalinization of 0.033 units. Measurements of homogenate PCO2 suggested that most of the CO2 remained in the sample during pHm measurement at 37 degrees C. The present work substantiates the use of the homogenate technique as an accurate and practical method for the estimation of intracellular pH in resting and exercise human muscle samples.',\n",

Little is known about airflow characteristics of the complex nasopharyngeal airway of humans and experimental animals. Airflow characteristics in the nasopharyngeal airways of an adult male baboon (13.9 kg body wt) were investigated with thermistor probes and the findings compared with flow visualization, using a cinephotographic technique. A clear, acrylic, hollow cast of a baboon nose was made, and thermistor probes were inserted to record air velocity in the cast lumen using a wind tunnel to propel air through the cast. An identical cast was studied by passing water through the cast, with pulses of dye to reveal flow, and cinephotography was used for determination of flow velocities and flow patterns. Flow rates adjusted on the basis of a Reynolds conversion showed good correlations between the two methods, whereas cinephotography revealed areas of turbulence and vortex-like flow not detected by thermistor probes. These results suggest that water flow may provide useful information in complex airways where airflow cannot be determined by other methods.',\n",

Each of the eighteen compartment syndromes was documented by measurements of intracompartmental pressure that were obtained by the saline-injection technique, and all were treated by four-compartment fasciotomy. The incidence of compartment syndrome was found to be directly proportional to the degree of injury to soft tissue and bone; this complication occurred most often in association with a comminuted, grade-III open injury to a pedestrian.

The sensory changes include burning pain, numbness, tingling, and loss of sensation, while the motor changes range from weakness to complete paralysis. The episodes are transient and complete recovery usually occurs in ten to fifteen minutes, although in some patients gradual resolution occurs over a period of thirty-six to forty-eight hours. Except for burning paresthesia, pain in the neck is not present at the time of injury and there is complete return of motor function and full, pain-free motion of the cervical spine. In our series, routine roentgenograms of the cervical spine were negative for fractures or dislocations in all patients. However, the roentgenographic findings did include developmental spinal stenosis in seventeen patients, congenital fusion in five patients, cervical instability in four patients, and intervertebral disc disease in six patients. Spinal stenosis was determined by two different roentgenographic methods. The first was the standard method, and the second was a ratio method devised by us. Both measurements were made at the level of the third through the sixth vertebral body on a routine lateral roentgenogram of the cervical spine that was available for twenty-four of the thirty-two patients and for a control group of forty-nine male subjects of similar age who did not have any neurological complaints. Using the ratio method, a measurement of less than 0.80 indicated significant spinal stenosis in the group of twenty-four patients for whom roentgenograms were available, as compared with a ratio of approximately 1.00 or more in the control group. There was statistically significant spinal stenosis (p less than 0.0001) in all of the patients as compared with the control subjects by both methods of determining spinal stenosis.

Ingrowth of bone into all three types of porous coating was observed, indicating secure fixation of all components. By six months, there was more ingrowth of bone and new medullary bone adjacent to the proximal and distal aspects of the stems compared with the middle level of the stems in all groups. No significant difference in ingrowth of bone was observed in the beaded surface (25.2 per cent) and the fiber-metal surface (16.6 per cent) at one month, but at six months there was significantly less ingrowth into the beaded surface (23.3 per cent) than into the fiber-metal surface (37.3 per cent).

All of the patients had degenerative joint disease. Survivorship analysis was used to calculate a predicted cumulative rate of success for this series of total hip replacements over ten years of follow-up. This method of analysis of the data was chosen because it provides a prediction of the expected durability of a total hip arthroplasty in any individual patient. The need for revision because of loosening or infection or else radiographic evidence of migration of a component was the criterion for failure. Two revisions were performed for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component. One infection necessitated revision, and radiographic evidence of loss of fixation was seen in one additional acetabular component and one femoral stem. Life-table calculations predicted that the survivorship of all of the total hip replacements in this series would be 87.6 per cent at ten years of follow-up.

Before operation all the knees were painful, 50.5% severely; a further 45.7% disturbed sleep at night. At review 15.2% of knees were free of pain and 60% had only slight pain which did not restrict activity. The preoperative range of movement was maintained and there was only a slight tendency for radiological changes to progress, with actual improvement in some cases. No correlation was found between the correction of deformity to physiological valgus and the result. We cannot explain why tibial osteotomy produces such useful and sustained pain relief.',\n",

Using actuarial methods, the probability of the prosthesis remaining in situ after six years was calculated. In osteoarthritis this probability ranged from 65% for hinged prostheses to 90% for medial compartment prostheses. Two-and three-compartment prostheses produced intermediate results with 87% survival. In rheumatoid arthritis the probability varied from 72% for medial compartment prostheses to 90% for two- and three-compartment prostheses. The main reason for failure was loosening of the components, the second most common was infection. The probability of revision for infection by six years was 2% in osteoarthritis and 3% in rheumatoid arthritis. Most revisions were to a three-compartment prosthesis. Knee fusion at primary revision was required in 2% of the cases at six years.',\n",

Study of the cleavage lines around the knee demonstrated that the medial parapatellar incision lies parallel to the lines, whilst the anterior midline incision lies perpendicular to them. In addition, the medial parapatellar wound was found to be subjected to significantly less tension during flexion; after arthroplasty it can be expected to heal faster and to be less liable to disruption during early mobilisation.',\n",

We prepared a basement membrane matrix from autogenous striated muscle, used it to repair the sciatic nerve in rats, then investigated the results by histology and electrophysiology. When treated grafts were coaxially aligned with the nerve fascicles functional recovery appeared within 30 days, with good growth of axons into the distal nerve. Grafts with myotubes at right angles to the nerve fascicles supported nerve regeneration but at a slower rate. Grafts of coaxially aligned but untreated muscle allowed axon penetration only through naturally degenerated muscle fibres, with minimal axon penetration of the distal nerve. It is concluded that in the rat a treated graft with correctly orientated empty myotubes can facilitate and guide the regeneration of peripheral nerve after injury and so lead to recolonisation of the distal stump with functional recovery.',\n",

Arthrography showed that the configuration of the ankle was apparently normal in patients under 10 months of age and that a ball-and-socket joint develops by four to five years of age, possibly in compensation for the loss of inversion and eversion caused by tarsal coalition. Ball-and-socket joint is therefore probably not congenital, but is an acquired deformity secondary to various pre-existing congenital conditions.',\n",

Three of the patients were men and twelve were women. They ranged in age from 9 to 75 years. Their symptoms were chest pain, dyspnea, cough, palpitation and syncope. Definite diagnosis was confirmed by echo- and cineangiocardiography. There were 14 benign tumors consisting of 13 myxomas, one leiomyoma and one malignant myxosarcoma. The left atrium was the most common chamber involved (12 instances), followed by the right atrium (3). Surgery was performed in all cases under cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia and cold crystalloid cardioplegia. Tumors were removed en bloc at the base with their attachment to the atrial septum or free wall in all cases. Three patients underwent concomitant mitral annuloplasty or mitral commissurotomy. Two cases with left atrial myxoma died postoperatively: one case associated with mitral annuloplasty died of congestive heart failure due to newly developed chordal rupture two months after surgery, and the other died of congestive heart failure 13 months after the first operation. Re-excision for recurrence of the myxosarcoma in the left atrium was performed in the latter case as a second surgical procedure. The remaining 13 cases with benign tumors are doing well and are without recurrence. From these favorable results, surgical intervention should be recommended prior to the occurrence of heart failure and severe complications such as coronary or peripheral embolism whenever cardiac tumors are detected by non-invasive echocardiography and cineangiocardiography.',\n",

Post-operative blood loss in the 9 transfused early averaged 894 +/- 176 ml (SEM). Loss from the not transfused patients averaged 481 +/- 18 ml (p less than 0.001). Patients transfused later had a mean loss of 510 +/- 36 ml (P NS). Sixty-nine patients were not transfused. Haemoglobin on the first post-operative day was 11.3 +/- 1.3 G/dl (SD).

Thrombosis made reconstruction difficult and at times required a femoro-tibial graft. In others reconstruction was not possible leading to amputation either as primary treatment or following failed revascularization.

To identify age-related alterations in vitamin D and PTH physiology and to assess their impact on skeletal health, we studied 62 normal men, aged 30-92 yr. The men were in excellent health, and none had any evidence of metabolic bone disease and/or known risk factors for osteopenia. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations declined steadily with advancing age (r = -0.47; P less than 0.001), and there was a corresponding decline in serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25-(OH)2D] levels (r = -0.41; P less than 0.001). Serum 1,25-(OH)2D concentrations, however, did not vary over this age range (r = -0.07; P = NS). Plasma PTH levels increased with aging (r = -0.24; P less than 0.001), and there was a concomitant increase in urinary cAMP excretion (r = 0.38; P less than 0.001). Renal function (creatinine clearance) clearly declined with increasing age (r = -0.71; P less than 0.001). In conjunction with these changes in calcium metabolism, radial and vertebral bone mineral content declined. Whereas the fall in radial bone mineral content (single photon absorptiometry) at both proximal and distal sites was slight, there was a marked decrease in vertebral bone mineral content, as measured by quantitative computed tomography (r = -0.72; P less than 0.0001). The fall in vertebral bone mineral content correlated well with the declines in serum 25OHD and 24,25-(OH)2D concentrations (r = 0.47; P less than 0.001 and r = 0.51; P less than 0.001, respectively) and with the decline in renal function (r = 0.46; P less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the effects of aging on bone mineral content could be accounted for in large part by concomitant changes in mineral metabolism. Both the decline in renal function and the fall in serum 24,25-(OH)2D levels were closely associated with the fall in bone mineral content. These results indicate that a decline in renal function and alterations in vitamin D metabolism occur with aging in normal men.

The THF/5 alpha-THF ratios, however, were lower in both the normal children and the affected infants, suggesting increased 5 alpha-reductase activity in infancy. The affected infants had THF/5 alpha-THF ratios comparable to ratios in adult carrier males and significantly lower than ratios in adult homozygotes.

Five antibodies that varied by either their affinity for beta hCG or their specificity for epitopes on CTP were investigated. To measure hormone levels, we used as the radiolabeled indicator an alpha-subunit-reactive Mab. The monoclonal-immunoradiometric assay had a lower limit of sensitivity of 0.05 ng/ml. Serum levels of hCG or hCG-like material with CTP structure were measured in 229 healthy blood donors; 1.1% of healthy men and 4.6% of nonpregnant women younger than 50 yr had serum values varying between 0.05 and 0.23 ng/ml. Moreover, 6 to 7 healthy women older than 50 yr had detectable levels in the 0.05-0.20 ng/ml range. To study the disappearance rates in normal women, we followed serum hCG serum levels of 6 women who had previously received a single im injection of the hormone. These individuals failed to develop a pregnancy after in vitro fertilization; hCG declined from 0.5 to 0.05 ng/ml within 2 weeks. These results were in contrast to the findings in 12 patients with hCG-producing tumors. In 9 patients without any evidence of recurrent disease, hCG levels became undetectable within 5 months. However, 3 others had levels consistently above 0.05 but below 0.5 ng/ml. In 2 of these three patients, subsequent increasing hCG levels were associated with tumor recurrence.

Cortisol binding to transcortin was normal. Plasma androstenedione and testosterone levels were also increased, but 17-hydroxyprogesterone and aldosterone levels were normal. Further studies revealed an increased cortisol production rate, increased 24-h urinary cortisol excretion, increased plasma ACTH levels, a normal diurnal rhythm of cortisol at an elevated level, and normal increments of plasma ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The father and two brothers also had increased plasma cortisol levels, which did not suppress normally in response to dexamethasone. Chronic therapy with dexamethasone (at first 1 and later 0.5 mg, three times daily) for more than 30 weeks resulted in decreased hirsutism, normalization of scalp hair and menstrual cyclicity, and normal plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels. No signs or symptoms of Cushing\\'s syndrome developed, and the central regulation of secretion of ACTH, cortisol, GH, and PRL (insulin test, diurnal rhythm) remained qualitatively normal at a lower set-point. We conclude that this patient had autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary (partial) cortisol insensitivity, which had resulted in increased adrenocortical cortisol and androgen secretion. The latter had not resulted in clinical symptoms in the three afflicted male members of the family, but had in the propositus. The results also indicate the potential usefulness of the insulin test in distinguishing this disorder from Cushing\\'s disease.',\n",

If pituitary glands were obtained within 3 h after sudden death of previously normal individuals, the viability of isolated pituitary cells prepared by dispersion with dispase was more than 75%. After 4 days of culture, dopamine (500 nM) inhibited PRL release by cells prepared from four normal pituitaries by 24 +/- 3% (+/- SEM). Pretreatment of the cells with 100 nM estradiol did not alter dopamine-mediated inhibition of PRL release. Estradiol alone increased basal PRL release and cell PRL content. Cultured PRL-secreting pituitary tumor cells, obtained by transsphenoidal operation from four patients, were similarly sensitive to dopamine. Estradiol stimulated tumor cell PRL release and content, but significantly diminished the inhibitory effect of dopamine. The estrogen receptor blocker tamoxifen did not alter PRL release, but it did reverse the estradiol-induced insensitivity of the prolactinoma cells to the dopamine agonist bromocriptine. In conclusion, these in vitro results indicate that estrogens do not antagonize the effect of dopamine on normal human PRL-secreting pituitary cells. In human pituitary tumor cells, however, estradiol decreased the sensitivity of PRL release to dopamine (agonists), and the estrogen action can be acutely reversed by tamoxifen.',\n",

The plasma levels of testosterone propionate-19,19,19-d3 were maintained at 2-4 ng/ml between 3 and 36 h after administration. Plasma testosterone-19,19,19-d3 levels were maintained above the physiological testosterone level for 48 h, while plasma levels of endogenous testosterone changed little.',\n",
       " '87057947': \"The therapeutic value of ketoconazole for long term treatment of patients with Cushing's syndrome was studied. Seven patients with Cushing's disease and one with an adrenal adenoma received 600-800 mg/day ketoconazole for 3-13 months. Plasma ACTH, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels and urinary cortisol, 17-ketosteroid, and tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol excretion were determined periodically during the treatment period. Plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH stimulation were determined before and during treatment. Rapid and subsequently persistent clinical improvement occurred in each patient; plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and urinary 17-ketosteroid and cortisol excretion decreased soon after the initiation of treatment, subsequently remaining normal or nearly so throughout the treatment period. Urinary tetrahydro-11-deoxycortisol excretion increased significantly. Plasma cortisol levels decreased. Plasma ACTH levels did not change, and individual plasma ACTH and cortisol increments in response to CRH were comparable before and during treatment. The cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia improved in one patient and was restored to normal in another. The seven patients tested recovered normal adrenal suppressibility in response to a low dose of dexamethasone during ketoconazole treatment. Ketoconazole is effective for long term control of hypercortisolism of either pituitary or adrenal origin. Its effect appears to be mediated by inhibition of adrenal 11 beta-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, and it, in some unknown way, prevents the expected rise in ACTH secretion in patients with Cushing's disease.\",\n",

No C-terminal galanin-like immunoreactivity was detected in plasma or tissue, suggesting differences in the amino acid sequence of human compared with porcine galanin. A non-C-terminally directed antibody was, therefore, used to characterize human galanin immunoreactivity by gel permeation chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and to localize it by immunocytochemistry. The galanin content of whole adrenal gland was 2.6 +/- 0.9 (+/- SEM) pmol/g (n = 5). In contrast, however, pheochromocytomas had much greater concentrations (21 +/- 2.3 pmol/g; n = 16). Gel chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography revealed 2 molecular forms of galanin immunoreactivity with identical elution positions in both normal adrenals and tumors. The concentration of galanin in plasma from both normal subjects and pheochromocytoma patients was below the detection limit of the assay (less than 10 pmol/liter). Using immunocytochemistry, galanin was localized to scattered cells or clusters of tumor cells in 5 of 11 pheochromocytomas and only a few chromaffin cells and cortical nerve fibers in normal adrenals.',\n",

In 25 patients, localization of enlarged parathyroid glands was successful. In 2 patients, the tumors were located retrosternally and, thus, could not be detected by ultrasound. One patient had a multinodular goiter which impeded localization. In 1 patient with renal osteodystrophy, 2 enlarged parathyroid glands in the neck were not visualized preoperatively. Cytology was not diagnostic, although some cytological features were suggestive of parathyroid cells. Immunostaining of the aspirated smears for PTH, however, correctly diagnosed all preoperatively localized lesions. Ultrasound should be the routine procedure of choice for preoperative localization of abnormal parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism. Fine needle aspiration and immunocytochemistry can supply confirmation, if necessary.',\n",
       " '87057952': 'The concentration of FFA in normal human plasma in vivo generally ranges between 0.2 and 0.7 meq/liter; slightly higher concentrations have occasionally been reported in patients who are seriously ill. To determine whether such FFA concentrations may increase the concentration of free T4 in serum, we added increasing amounts of oleic acid to pooled normal human serum (with known FFA content) and measured free T4 by equilibrium dialysis. Total FFA up to 3 meq/liter in normal serum, representing an FFA to albumin molar ratio of about 5:1, had little or no effect on the free T4 concentration, while higher FFA concentrations progressively increased free T4. This same molar ratio of FFA to albumin had to be exceeded to cause a significant increase in the free T4 concentration in diluted serum and in serum from patients with nonthyroid illness. Serum from which more than 95% of the albumin had been removed by chromatography with Affi-Gel blue was much more sensitive to the effects of FFA on free T4. This enhanced sensitivity was reversed by readdition of albumin to the serum, and the addition of albumin to normal serum resulted in diminished effects of FFA on free T4. These results indicate the following: physiological concentrations of FFA do not significantly increase the free T4 concentration in normal human serum; when FFA reach supraphysiological concentrations in serum (in vitro) and the higher affinity FFA-binding sites on albumin become saturated (apparently at an FFA to albumin molar ratio of approximately 5:1), the excess FFA interact with other serum proteins, including thyroid hormone-binding globulin, and thereby increase the free T4 concentration; the concentration of albumin (or other FFA binders) must be considered when evaluating the observed effects of FFA. To explore the relevance of these findings to the hypothesis that FFA may inhibit the binding of T4 to plasma proteins in patients with nonthyroid illness, we measured plasma FFA concentrations in 11 severely ill patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit. We found a mean plasma FFA concentration of 0.45 +/- 0.11 (+/- SEM) mEq/liter and a mean serum albumin concentration of 2.39 +/- 0.29 g/dl in these patients. Their mean plasma FFA to albumin molar ratio was 1.53 +/- 0.41. Since the FFA to albumin molar ratio must exceed about approximately 5:1 before a significant increase in the serum free T4 concentration occurs, these results suggest that FFA do not commonly influence the circulating free T4 concentration in vivo, even in severely ill patients.',\n",

A reasonable assessment of bioavailable T can be made by using 50% ammonium sulfate to precipitate sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-bound T. The supernatant non-SHBG-bound T (non-SHBG-T) correlates well with physiological androgen activity. To assess bioavailable T in normal aging men, we analyzed serum samples from seven healthy aged men (65-83 yr old) and compared the results to samples from 13 young men (22-39 yr old). Mean serum T, FT, and LH concentrations were not significantly different in the 2 groups. However, the mean absolute non-SHBG-T level was significantly lower (P less than 0.005) in the older group. In a separate population of 20 impotent but otherwise healthy men (5 27-37 yr old, 10 48-64 yr old, and 5 66-69 yr old), the mean absolute non-SHBG-T concentration was lower in middle-aged (P less than .01) and elderly men (P less than 0.001) than in young men. The absolute FT was lower only in the elderly group (P less than 0.05), while mean LH and T levels were similar in all 3 age groups. These data suggest that serum concentrations of tissue available T are decreased in aged men and that non-SHBG-T measurement is a more sensitive indicator of this decrease than are serum T or serum FT measurements. These changes appear to begin by middle age.',\n",
       " '87057961': 'Cultured normal human pulmonary alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages were studied for their capacity to metabolize [3H]25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3). Incubation of macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in the conversion of [3H]25OHD3 to a more polar vitamin D3 metabolite (up to 15 pmol/10(6) cells). Untreated macrophages did not synthesize this metabolite. Several findings suggested that the metabolite was the biologically active form of vitamin D3, namely 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]. (1) The metabolite comigrated with chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3 on four different high performance liquid chromatographic systems. (2) The metabolite had the same affinity for the chick intestinal 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor as authentic 1,25-(OH)2D3. (3) The biological activity of the macrophage metabolite in vivo (stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization in rachitic chicks) was identical to the activity of chemically synthesized 1,25-(OH)2D3. The LPS-stimulated synthesis of the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like compound by macrophages was dose dependent in a linear fashion; a half-maximal response was typically found with 100-200 ng LPS/10(6) cells. Polymyxin B abolished the effects of LPS on 25OHD3 metabolism in macrophages. Our data suggest that LPS-stimulated macrophages can modulate, on a local level, the function of 1,25-(OH)2D3-responsive cells by releasing the 1,25-(OH)2D3-like metabolite.',\n",

Pretreatment (day 3) serum T4 and T3 concentrations were 49 micrograms/dl and 590 ng/dl, respectively. With 24 h after the first dose of ipodate, serum T3 fell by 40%, and it subsequently ranged from 209-278 ng/dl throughout the 39-day ipodate treatment period. Serum T4 also decreased after ipodate administration to 69% and 41% of the pretreatment value after 72 h and 7 days of treatment, respectively; values thereafter during treatment ranged from 19-22 micrograms/dl. These plateau values are in the upper range of normal for the neonatal period. Rapid clinical improvement occurred as the hyperiodothyroninemia abated. Serum rT3 concentrations increased from 468-672 ng/dl to greater than 1400 ng/dl 24 h after each ipodate dose. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin was present in maternal and cord sera, and the half-life of serum thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin in the infant was approximately 12 days. Antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies were present in the infant at 10 days of age, and the titers decreased progressively thereafter; the half-life for the antimicrosomal antibody titer was 3 weeks.

Both groups of patients were receiving T4 when studied. [3H]Thymidine incorporation induced by 0.1 mU/ml bovine TSH was significantly inhibited by the addition of 2 mg/ml IgG from patients with primary myxedema (P less than 0.01), while it was not affected by IgG from the normal subjects or 23 of the 24 patients with goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

The inhibition of TSH-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation by IgGs from patients with primary myxedema was significantly correlated with their inhibitory activities against both TSH-induced cAMP generation and TSH binding (P less than 0.001). These data indicate that these growth-blocking antibodies are directed against the TSH receptor and might be one of the causes of the thyroid atrophy in patients with primary myxedema.\",\n",
       " '87057968': 'Primary monolayer cultures of human fetal adrenal cells maintained in either lipoprotein-depleted or lipoprotein-supplemented media responded chronically to ACTH treatment with similarly increased steroid secretion. The principal steroid secreted into each medium was dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. The presence of human low density lipoprotein (hLDL) in the medium enhanced the secretion of nonsulfoconjugated steroids, especially dehydroepiandrosterone. The secretion rate of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione was similar to that of cortisol. In the absence of hLDL, ACTH increased cholesterologenesis to maintain the high rates of steroid secretion. After ACTH treatment, increased accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a rate-determining enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, was found. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that this enzyme was a 97K protein in human fetal adrenal cells. Interestingly, the content of this enzyme in cells treated with ACTH in lipoprotein-depleted medium was similar to that in adrenal fetal zone tissue. This finding suggests that cholesterologenesis de novo in addition to plasma LDL is important as a source of steroid precursor in vivo in the human fetal adrenal gland.',\n",

On the day after drug administration, blood samples were obtained at 15-min intervals for 8 h for serum LH determinations. Daily blood samples were also obtained throughout the luteal phase for determination of serum LH, estradiol (E2), and progesterone. LH pulse frequency increased from 2.4 +/- 0.5 (+/- SEM)/8 h after placebo to 3.9 +/- 0.6/8 h (P less than 0.01) after CC treatment, but pulse amplitude did not change. The transverse mean of serum LH was higher after CC (13.6 +/- 0.5 mIU/ml) than after placebo (8.4 +/- 0.3 mIU/ml; P less than 0.001), and luteal phase length was increased from 13.5 +/- 0.5 to 16.0 +/- 0.4 days (P less than 0.001) by administration of CC. Luteal phase levels of E2 and progesterone measured daily were significantly elevated (P less than 0.01) in CC-treated cycles. These findings suggest that CC increases the frequency of hypothalamic GnRH secretory episodes, perhaps by an action involving a decrease in endogenous opioid peptide activity. Since peripheral progesterone levels were elevated in the CC-treated cycles, E2 may play a permissive role in the ability of progesterone to increase endogenous opioid peptide activity acutely. Furthermore, since the luteal phase was significantly prolonged by an increase in endogenous LH pulse frequency, the slow frequency of LH pulses in the normal late luteal phase may contribute to the onset of luteolysis in the human.',\n",

Sixteen alcohol users gave birth to infants with the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), whereas the remaining 24 infants of alcohol users and all infants of the abstinent women were healthy. The women whose infants had the FAS had decreased estradiol and estriol levels throughout pregnancy. Progesterone levels also tended to be low. In contrast, the alcohol users had increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy compared with those in the abstinent women, but this rise was not related to the FAS. The concentrations of hCG fluctuated widely, without any consistent difference between alcohol users and abstinent women. Thus, heavy maternal abuse of alcohol resulting in FAS is accompanied, primarily or secondarily, by reduced estrogen concentrations throughout pregnancy and increased PRL levels during the 16-24th weeks of pregnancy.',\n",

Sleep was denied for 64 h from 0700 h on awakening from accommodation sleep until polygraphic sleep was resumed at 7100 h of the third day (D3) such that 2 consecutive nights of usual 2300-0700 h sleep were missed. This protocol allowed examination of any modulatory effects on the daily patterns in TSH concentrations during sleep deprivation on D1-2 (1100-3500, 3500-5900 h) or during resumption of usual nightly sleep on D3 (5900-8300) compared to that of a previously studied group of normal young men. The circadian nature of the daily TSH waveform was evidenced by its daily repetition within a subject both basally and during D1-2 sleep deprivation and by its synchronization within the basal, deprived, or resumed sleep days. The peaks in each subject's daily TSH patterns on D1-2 were consistently longer, and the daily maxima and cosine acrophases on D1-2 were consistently later than those on D3 when basal sleep was resumed. About half the daily TSH concentration maxima and daily cosinor amplitudes on D1-2 were greater than those of the respective sleep-resumed TSH patterns of D3. Both the group mean TSH patterns and the cosinor 95% confidence ellipses also indicated the daily peak in the TSH waveform to be significantly longer, later, and larger during D1-2 sleep deprivation than during the basal or D3 periods. These results indicate that significant alteration of the daily TSH waveform can occur in response to absence of sleep and are compatible with the existence of an inhibitory effect in early nightly sleep on TSH release. The TSH patterns during the 1700-2300 h intervals of rising TSH levels were congruent in the basal, deprived, and resumed sleep periods. Prompt reversion to the basal TSH pattern also occurred when sleep was resumed on D3. Both of these observations suggest the alteration in TSH waveform during sleep deprivation to have arisen from an inhibitory effect in sleep rather than from a change in period or phase of a generating oscillator.\",\n",

Differences between the patient groups were compared by two-way analysis of variance. The ability of insulin to either suppress plasma FFA concentrations or stimulate glucose uptake was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) in patients with NIDDM, and this was true of both the obese and nonobese groups. The defect in the ability of insulin to suppress plasma FFA concentrations in patients with NIDDM was more apparent at the lower insulin concentration, whereas resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in NIDDM was more dramatic at the high insulin concentration. Finally, a significant correlation (r = -0.67; P less than 0.001) between insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and plasma FFA concentration was found in the entire group. These data emphasize the fact that patients with NIDDM are resistant to multiple actions of insulin, and that the magnitudes of the defect in insulin suppression of plasma FFA levels and stimulation of tissue glucose uptake are roughly comparable.',\n",

She had two episodes in the year following incomplete transphenoidal pituitary tumor resection, but has had none in 2 yr since receiving radiotherapy. The episodes were caused by mineralocorticoid actions of large ACTH-induced increases in cortisol and deoxycorticosterone secretion.

To test this hypothesis, we studied five normal women and one woman with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. Each woman received a 0.1 U/kg insulin bolus dose, followed by a 10 mU/kg X min insulin infusion for 12-16 h. In the normal women, an average insulin level of 1832 +/- 292 (+/- SEM) microU/ml was achieved; serum glucose was clamped at 116 +/- 5 mg/dl. At this level, insulin may bind to the insulin-like growth factor I receptor as well as to its own receptor. Contrary to our working hypothesis, a rise in serum testosterone did not occur in any women during insulin infusion, and in one women, serum testosterone levels decreased. When analyzed as a percentage of the basal value, serum progesterone levels fell 20% in the normal women within the first 2 h of insulin infusion, but did not change thereafter. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) levels, however, uniformly and progressively decreased by 39% after 12 h of insulin infusion in the normal women and by 31% at 14 h in the woman with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans. The fall in serum DHEA-S levels was not due to diurnal rhythmicity, as the changes in serum DHEA-S levels did not correlated with those in serum cortisol. Suppression of PRL release also was excluded as a cause of the fall in DHEA-S levels. These results indicate that acute hyperinsulinemia of 12- to 16-h duration does not increase serum testosterone or DHEA-S concentrations and, indeed, can cause a decline in serum DHEA-S levels in both normal women and the single woman studied with hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and acanthosis nigricans.',\n",

The binding of MAb 4F2 to human adenomatous dPTCs resulted in a marked [53.8 +/- 7.9% (+/- SEM)] reduction in low calcium (Ca)-stimulated PTH secretion to levels equivalent to those in cell suppressed by high extracellular Ca (1.5 mM). Typically, these functional effects were optimal at antibody dilutions of 1:10(4) to 1:10(5). Cell viability was confirmed at the conclusion of each experiment by trypan blue exclusion (greater than 90-95%) and cell surface immunofluorescence. Parallel studies using the Ca-sensitive dye Quin-2 showed that inhibition of PTH secretion in 4F2-treated cells was associated with a concomitant increase in cytosolic Ca (Cai) of 188% in 0.5 mM Ca; these values also approached Cai levels in control cells incubated in high Ca. Mab controls, P3 X 63, which do not bind to dPTCs, and Mab LC7-2, which recognizes a different epitope of the same antigen as 4F2 on dPTCs, did not alter PTH secretion or Cai.

These studies suggest that 1) Mab-4F2 binding to its cell surface antigen inhibits PTH secretion by human adenomatous parathyroid cells in vitro; 2) the alterations in secretory function could be related to by an attendant increase in Cai; 3) the 4F2 antigen on dPTCs is a heterodimeric protein of (approximately) 85K and 45K; and 4) the 4F2 antigen may be an important component of the Ca-sensing and/or signal-transducing mechanism in this cell.',\n",

A computer-assisted pulse analysis program was used to assess both total GH secretion, as reflected in the 24-h integrated GH concentration (IGHC), and pulsatile secretion, as denoted by pulse frequency, duration, amplitude, and the fraction of GH secreted in pulses during the 24-h period (FGHP). IGHC was significantly greater in women than in men (P less than 0.025) and greater in the young than in the old (P less than 0.003). The mean pulse amplitude, duration, and FGHP were each greater in the young (P less than 0.006, P less than 0.03, and P less than 0.0001, respectively), but not significantly different between the sexes. The mean pulse frequency was not affected by sex or age. The serum concentration of free estradiol, but not free testosterone, correlated with IGHC (r = 0.46; P less than 0.005), pulse amplitude (r = 0.53; P less than 0.001), and FGHP (r = 0.59; P less than 0.0002). After correcting for the effects of estradiol, neither sex nor age influenced IGHC or mean pulse amplitude, while the effect of age on FGHP was reduced from 81% to 29%. Of the indices of GH secretion, FGHP had the strongest correlation (r = 0.43; P less than 0.006) with somatomedin-C. Somatomedin-C declined significantly with age in both sexes. Our results indicate that sex and age have independent and interrelated effects on GH secretion. These effects can be largely accounted for by corresponding variations in endogenous estradiol levels.

The reversal potential (Vr) of the depolarization response to AII and AVP was -29 +/- 3 and -25 +/- 7 mV (mean +/- SD), respectively. Not only the Vr of the AII-induced depolarization but also Vr of the Ca ionophore-induced response was dependent upon the extracellular Cl- concentration. Further, AII and AVP caused cell contraction and membrane depolarization in Ca++-free medium containing 0.5 mM EGTA.

The mutation in pro alpha 2(I) causes increased posttranslational modification in the amino-terminal half of some pro alpha 1(I) chains, lowers the melting temperature of type I collagen molecules that incorporate a mutant pro alpha 2(I) chain, and prevents or delays the secretion of those molecules from fibroblasts in cell culture. On the basis of this study and linkage studies in additional families, it appears that the OI type IV phenotype is often the result of heterozygosity for mutations in pro alpha 2(I) that alter the triple helical structure of type I collagen.',\n",
       " '87058099': 'Differences in aortic impedance between normotensives and hypertensives are not well characterized. We examined impedance in 8 normotensive and 11 hypertensive (mean 96.7 vs. 122.2 mmHg) age-matched, Chinese patients undergoing cardiac catheterization at rest, during nitroprusside, and handgrip exercise before and after beta blockade (propranolol). Hypertensives had higher resistance (2,295 vs. 1713 dyn-s/cm5), characteristic impedance (145.7 vs. 93.9 dyn-s/cm5), total external power (1,579 vs. 1174 mW), peripheral reflections (ratio of backward to forward wave components of 0.54 vs. 0.44), and first zero crossing of impedance phase angle (4.15 vs. 2.97 Hz). These abnormalities were eliminated with vasodilatation. Differences between groups were not further exacerbated when pressure was increased during handgrip exercise. Beta blockade further increased resistance and reflections. Thus, hemodynamic abnormalities of essential hypertension (increased resistance, reflections, and pulse wave velocity, and decreased compliance) are compatible with an increased vasomotor tone that is further unmasked during generalized beta blockade.',\n",
       " '87058100': 'The present studies examined the mechanism of bicarbonate transport across basolateral membrane vesicles prepared from rabbit renal cortex. Isotopic sodium uptake was stimulated by bicarbonate when compared with gluconate (2.5 nmol/mg protein per 5 s versus 1.4 nmol/mg protein per 5 s), and this process was inhibited by disulfonic stilbenes. Imposition of an interior-positive potassium diffusion potential further stimulated isotopic sodium uptake to 3.4 nmol/mg protein per 5 s, an effect that occurred only in the presence of bicarbonate and was blocked by disulfonic stilbenes. Kinetic analysis of the rate of bicarbonate-dependent sodium uptake as a function of sodium concentration revealed saturable stimulation with a Vmax of 2.7 nmol/mg protein per 2 s and a Km of 10.4 mM. The effect of bicarbonate concentration on bicarbonate-dependent sodium uptake was more complex. The present results demonstrate an electrogenic (negatively charged) sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter in basolateral membrane vesicles from the rabbit renal cortex. The electrogenicity implies a stoichiometry of at least two bicarbonate ions for each sodium ion.',\n",
       " '87058102': 'The mechanism by which sickle cells and xerocytic red cells become depleted of cations in vivo has not been identified previously. Both types of cells exhibit elevated permeabilities to sodium and potassium, in the case of sickle cells, when deoxygenated. The ouabain-insensitive fluxes of sodium and potassium were equivalent, however, in both cell types under these conditions. When incubated 18 hours in vitro, sickle cells lost cations but only when deoxygenated. This cation depletion was blocked by ouabain, removal of external potassium, or pretreatment with 4,4\\'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2\\'-disulfonate, which blocks the increase in cation permeability induced by deoxygenation. The loss of cation exhibited by oxygenated xerocytes similarly incubated was also blocked by ouabain. These data support the hypothesis that the elevated \"passive\" cation fluxes of xerocytes and deoxygenated sickle cells are not directly responsible for cation depletion of these cells; rather, these pathologic leaks interact with the sodium pump to produce a net loss of cellular cation.',\n",
       " '87058103': 'The ontogenic switch from fetal to adult hemoglobin could result from discontinuous events, such as replacement of fetal erythroid progenitor cells by adult ones, or gradual modulation of the hemoglobin program of a single progenitor cell pool. The former would result in progenitors at midswitch with skewed fractional beta-globin synthesis programs, the latter in a Gaussian distribution. For these studies, we obtained bone marrow from rhesus monkey fetuses at 141-153 d (midswitch). Mononuclear cells were cultured in methyl cellulose with erythropoietin, and single BFU-E-derived colonies were removed and incubated with [3H]leucine. Globin synthesis was examined by gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The beta-globin synthesis pattern of single fetal colonies was skewed, and did not fit a normal distribution. The fetal pattern resembled the pattern of an artificial mixture of fetal and adult progenitors, suggesting that the fetal progenitor pool could contain populations with different beta-globin programs. This non-Gaussian distribution in the progenitors of midswitch fetuses is consistent with a discontinuous model for hemoglobin switching during ontogeny.',\n",

Although the assay was directed against a 53-kD, acid-stable BP subunit, the main immunoreactive BP in the circulation had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 125 kD. Only higher primate species showed cross-reactivity, and IGF-I, IGF-II, and other peptides were without effect. Circulating BP levels in healthy subjects rose threefold from early childhood to puberty. In 65 adults aged 18 to 65, the mean level (+/- SD) was 6.12 +/- 1.43 micrograms/ml, and declined with age. Strong growth hormone-dependence of BP was also seen; there was a 2.2-fold increase in active acromegaly and a 50-80% reduction in growth hormone deficiency. Poorly controlled diabetic subjects had BP levels 40% below normal, whereas in renal failure and third-term pregnancy a mild elevation was seen. Measurement of BP may provide a useful adjunct to IGF assays in growth disorders.',\n",
       " '87058106': 'Studies were designed to explore the association of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL) activities with lipoproteins in human postheparin plasma (PHP). The major peak of LPL activity after gel filtration of PHP eluted after the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and just before the peak of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. When PHP contained chylomicrons, an additional peak of LPL activity eluted in the void volume of the column. Most HTGL activity eluted after the LDL and preceded the elution of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. LPL activity in preheparin plasma eluted in the same position, relative to lipoproteins, as did LPL in PHP. Gel filtration of purified human milk LPL mixed with plasma or isolated LDL produced a peak of activity eluting before LDL. During gel filtration of PHP in high salt buffer (1 M NaCl) or after isolation of lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation in high salt density solutions, most of the lipase activity was not associated with lipoproteins. LPL activity was removed from PHP by elution through immunoaffinity columns containing antibodies to apolipoprotein (apo) B and apo E. Since lipoproteins in PHP have undergone prior in vivo lipolysis, LPL activity in PHP may be bound to remnants of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins.',\n",
       " '87058107': 'Hypocalcemic vitamin D (D)-depleted rats were supplemented with calcium or 1,25(OH)2D3, and the metabolism of D3 to 25(OH)D3 was studied. Infusion with 7 or 65 pmol 1,25(OH)2D3 X 24 h-1 led to normal or slight hypercalcemia associated with physiological and supraphysiological plasma concentrations of the hormone while calcium supplementation normalized plasma calcium despite 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations as low as those observed in hypocalcemic controls. Constant administrations of [14C]D3 during the supplementation regimens uncovered a stimulation of the in vivo 25(OH)D3 production by calcium supplementation; this was further confirmed in vitro by an increase in the hepatic microsomal D3-25 hydroxylase. The group supplemented with pharmacological doses of the hormone displayed lower circulating concentrations of both D3 and 25(OH)D3 while the in vitro 25(OH)D3 production remained unaffected by 1,25(OH)2D3. Investigation of the kinetics of intravenous 25(OH)[3H]D3 revealed similar elimination constants in all groups. The data indicate that calcium supplementation of hypocalcemic D-depleted rats results in an increased transformation of D3 into 25(OH)D3 while supplementation with 1,25(OH)2D3 does not affect the in vitro D3-25 hydroxylase but seems to influence the in vivo handling of the vitamin by accelerating its metabolism.',\n",

When single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) increased from 28.7 +/- 0.7 nl/min in hydropenia to 41.5 +/- 0.4 nl/min in euvolemia, bicarbonate, chloride, and water reabsorption in the early (1st mm) PCT increased proportionally: from 354 +/- 21 peq/mm X min, 206 +/- 55 peq/mm X min, and 5.9 +/- 0.4 nl/mm X min to 520 +/- 12 peq/mm X min, 585 +/- 21 peq/mm X min, and 10.1 +/- 0.4 nl/mm X min, respectively. These high transport rates did not increase further, however, when SNGFR went to 51.2 +/- 0.7 or 50.7 +/- 0.6 nl/min after atrial natriuretic factor or glucagon administration. Anion and water transport rates in the late PCT were lower and exhibited less flow dependence. During chronic metabolic alkalosis, acidification was inhibited in the late but not early PCT. In conclusion, the early PCT is distinguished from the late PCT by having high-capacity, flow-responsive but saturable, anion- and water-reabsorptive processes relatively unaffected by alkalemia.',\n",

Measurement of energy expenditure over periods of 24 h or longer is needed to determine more accurately rates of daily energy expenditure in humans. We provide a detailed description of a human respiratory chamber and methods used to determine rates of energy expenditure over 24-h periods in 177 subjects. The results show that: fat-free mass (FFM) as estimated by densitometry is the best available determinant of 24-h energy expenditures (24EE) and explains 81% of the variance observed between individuals (24EE [kcal/d] = 597 + 26.5 FFM); 24EE in an individual is very reproducible (coefficient of variation = 2.4%); and even when adjusted for differences in FFM, there is still considerable interperson variability of the daily energy expenditure. A large portion of the variability of 24EE among individuals, independent of differences in body size, was due to variability in the degree of spontaneous physical activity, i.e., \"fidgeting,\" which accounted for 100-800 kcal/d in these subjects.',\n",

Injury was measured as pneumocyte lysis and detachment, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Extracts of cotton dust and field-dried bract produced significant dose- and time-dependent lysis and detachment of both target cells, while green bract extract was less damaging. Extracts treated with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone to remove tannins produced significantly less injury. In contrast, purified 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxy-flavan 3,4-diol (THF), a tannin in cotton dust and bract, caused substantial cell damage. Field-dried bract extract and THF also produced dose-dependent inhibition of pneumocyte protein synthesis. Endotoxin levels did not correlate with observed injury. THF added to rat tracheal explants caused epithelial disruption and desquamation, whereas endotoxin did not. Instillation of cotton dust and field-dried bract extract in rat lungs produced disruption of bronchial epithelium and smooth muscle constriction, while polyvinylpolypyrrolidone-treated cotton dust extract produced no injury. These findings suggest that extracts of cotton plants are toxic to alveolar, tracheal, and bronchial epithelium and that THF or other tannins may be the responsible agents.\",\n",

We have found that the cochemotaxin attaches to the oligosaccharide chain of native C5a des Arg to form a complex with potent chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Although capable of enhancing the chemotactic activity of native C5a des Arg, the cochemotaxin had no effect on the chemotactic activity of either deglycosylated C5a des Arg, native C5a, or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Of the known components of the oligosaccharide chain, only sialic acid prevented enhancement by the cochemotaxin of the chemotactic activity exhibited by native C5a des Arg. Sialic acid also prevented the formation of C5a des Arg-cochemotaxin complexes, detected by acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, molecular sieve chromatography on polyacrylamide gels, and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation.',\n",

Deoxycholate alone did not induce these reactions. The other bile acids such as cholate, chenodeoxycholate, ursodeoxycholate, and taurocholate were also active. Under the similar conditions, deoxycholate enhanced the secretagogue-induced diacylglycerol formation that was derived mainly from the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate. Deoxycholate did not enhance the secretagogue-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate or Ca2+ mobilization. Deoxycholate did not affect amylase secretion, which was induced by the simultaneous addition of protein kinase C-activating 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Since diacylglycerol and Ca2+ may be responsible for the secretagogue-induced amylase secretion, our results indicate that small amounts of bile acids increase the sensitivity to the secretagogue of diacylglycerol formation and subsequent activation of protein kinase C, and thereby enhance amylase secretion from pancreatic acini.',\n",
       " '87058117': 'Cyclic AMP stimulates HCO3 secretion and Cl self-exchange in rabbit cortical collecting tubule. We found that varying peritubular [Cl] changed the Cl self-exchange rate with saturation kinetics (Km, 3-4 mM). HCO3 secretion also showed saturation kinetics as a function of mean luminal [Cl] (Km, 4-11 mM). Both Cl self-exchange and Cl-HCO3 exchange thus appear to be carrier-mediated. Addition/removal of basolateral HCO3 qualitatively changed Cl and HCO3 transport as expected for Cl-HCO3 exchange, but quantitatively changed Cl absorption more than HCO3 secretion. The diffusive Cl permeability and the transepithelial conductance in the presence of HCO3/CO2 and cAMP were higher than in their absence suggesting that HCO3/CO2 and cAMP together increase a conductive Cl pathway parallel to a 1:1 Cl-HCO3 exchanger. Thus, cAMP not only stimulates the overall process of anion exchange (probably by increasing an electroneutral exchanger and/or a series Cl conductance), but also stimulates a Cl conductance parallel to the exchange process.',\n",

When the morphological transitions are initiated by a temperature shift from 25 degrees to 37 degrees C, all three strains undergo similar physiological changes, but these are less severe in G184A and G222B than in the Downs strain. The transitions from mycelial to yeast morphology in both of the more virulent strains are also one-third more rapid than in Downs. We also find that the differences in temperature sensitivity of the three strains can be correlated with the temperature required for complete uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. The differences in sensitivity to elevated temperatures extend to the growth of yeast cells of all three strains. Considered together, our results suggest that sensitivity to elevated temperatures may be a key factor accounting for differences in virulence and that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation may be the primary event in the morphological transition in all three strains.',\n",
       " '87058124': 'During liquid preservation under blood bank conditions, red cell membranes inexorably undergo damage that decreases erythrocyte survival after transfusion. Accordingly, we have surveyed membrane skeletal protein interactions during storage. We uncovered a decrease in the in vitro formation of spectrin-actin complex in the absence (50%) or presence (60%) of protein 4.1. Actual formation of the spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 complex fell in a linear fashion during the storage period. This fall in spectrin-actin interaction tightly correlated with the decline in total red cell phospholipid (R = 0.9932) measured simultaneously. This decrement of spectrin-actin association could be restored to greater than 70% of normal values by preincubation of stored spectrin with 50 mM dithiothreitol. This storage injury to spectrin-actin interaction might weaken the membrane skeleton and lead to decreased red cell survival. In vitro reversibility of the damage by reducing agents suggests a possible new direction for prolonging the shelf life of stored blood.',\n",

Human eosinophils (25-95% purity) were obtained from donors with a variety of diseases associated with hypereosinophilia. PAF-acether elicited directional locomotion of eosinophils, in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, at concentrations from 10(-5) to 10(-8) M; lyso-PAF had minimal activity over the same dose range. Compared with PAF-acether, the eosinophil locomotory responsiveness of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), histamine, and the valyl- and alanyl-eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) tetrapeptides was negligible. Conversely, neutrophil responsiveness to PAF-acether (optimum 10(-6) M) was comparable in effect to LTB4 (optimum dose 10(-8) M). It was shown that PAF-acether elicited both chemotaxis and chemokinesis of eosinophils. Comparison of normal density and light density eosinophils revealed no qualitative difference in the response to PAF-acether and the other chemoattractants, although the light density cells seemed to demonstrate a greater degree of locomotion to PAF-acether and LTB4. Thus, PAF-acether appears to be a potent eosinophilotactic agent which may play a role in inflammatory reactions characterized by eosinophil infiltration.',\n",

Polyadenylated hepatic apoB-100 mRNA from two abetalipoproteinemic patients was normal in size, and the concentration of apoB-100 mRNA was increased sixfold compared with control hepatic apoB-100 mRNA levels. ApoB-100 was detected in hepatocytes of abetalipoproteinemic patients by immunohistochemical techniques.

Reactions were graded negative, weak, and intense. An intense reaction was found in 9% of cases; there was no difference between the various matched groups. Phenylhydrazine interposition failed to block the mPAS effect, indicating that a positive result was due to a deficiency of sialic acid with O-acetyl substituents rather than neutral mucin. Different staining patterns in left and right colon were probably due to differing ratios of total sialic acid:fucose. These findings indicate a hitherto unsuspected colorectal goblet cell sialomucin heterogeneity within the general population, but no association with neoplastic disease is apparent.',\n",

The authors analyzed 271 cases of ventricular fibrillation managed by EMT-Ds working without paramedic back-up. Of 111 patients initially converted to organized rhythms, 19 (17%) refibrillated, 11 (58%) of whom were reconverted to perfusing rhythms, including nine of 11 (82%) who had spontaneous pulses prior to refibrillation. Among patients initially converted to organized rhythms, hospital admission rates were lower for patients who refibrillated than for patients who did not (53% versus 76%, P = NS), although discharge rates were virtually identical (37% and 35%, respectively). Scene-to-hospital transport times were not predictively associated with either the frequency of refibrillation or patient outcome. Defibrillation-trained EMTs can effectively manage refibrillation with additional shocks and are not at a significant disadvantage when paramedic back-up is not available.'"
