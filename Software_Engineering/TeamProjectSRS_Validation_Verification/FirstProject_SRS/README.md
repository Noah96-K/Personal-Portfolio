# First Project (MQExpert)
In the first project, we made Software Requirement Specification using Use case diagram, use case description, interaction diagram, elicitation technique, and the interaction with the client representative.
'FirstProjectSpec' describes the first project, and the 'RequirementsElicitationAndSpecification' file is the main project file that I constructed.
