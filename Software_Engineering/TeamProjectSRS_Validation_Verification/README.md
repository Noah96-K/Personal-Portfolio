# Software Engineering Team Project
I conducted a team project of making an SRS and validation&verification plan to improve my basic knowledge about the software development processes.
This team is constituted of two members(me and my friend 'Vivian Wu').
We switched the roles and files that we made for each step to improve our understanding.
In the first project, we made Software Requirement Specification using Use case diagram, use case description, interaction diagram, elicitation technique, and the interaction with the client representative.
